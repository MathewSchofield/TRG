	abstract = {PLATO is a M-class candidate in the ESA Cosmic Vision program. PLATO's objective is to characterize exoplanets and their host stars in the solar neighbourhood. While it builds on the heritage from CoRoT and Kepler , the major breakthrough will come from its strong focus on bright targets (m V ≤ 11). The PLATO targets will also include a large number of very bright (m V ≤ 8) and nearby stars. The prime science goals of PLATO are: (i) the detection and characterization of exoplanetary systems of all kinds, including both the planets and their host stars, reaching down to small, terrestrial planets in the habitable zone; (ii) the identification of suitable targets for future, more detailed characterization, including a spectroscopic search for bio-markers in nearby habitable exoplanets. These ambitious goals will be reached by ultra-high precision, long (few years), uninterrupted photometric monitoring in the visible of very large samples of bright stars, which can only be done from space. The resulting high quality light curves will be used on the one hand to detect planetary transits, as well as to measure their characteristics, and on the other hand to provide a seismic analysis of the host stars of the detected planets, from which precise measurements of their radii, masses, and ages will be derived. The PLATO space-based data will be complemented by ground-based follow-up observations, in particular very precise radial velocity monitoring, which will be used to confirm the planetary nature of the detected events and to measure the planet masses. The full set of parameters of exoplanetary systems will thus be measured, including all characteristics of the host stars and the orbits, radii, masses, and ages of the planets, allowing us to derive planet mean densities, and estimate their temperature and radiation environment. Finally, the knowledge of the age of the exoplanetary systems will allow us to put them in an evolutionary perspective.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05661},
	abstract = {With current space-based missions it is now possible to obtain age-sensitive asteroseismic information for tens of thousands of red giants. This provides a promising opportunity to study the Galactic structure and evolution. We use asteroseismic data of red giants, observed by Kepler, to test the current theoretical framework of modelling the Galaxy based on population synthesis modeling and the use of asteroseismic scaling relations for giants. We use the open source code Galaxia to model the Milky Way and find the distribution of the masses predicted by Galaxia to be systematically offset with respect to the seismically-inferred observed masses. The Galactic model overestimates the number of low mass stars, and these stars are predominantly old and of low metallicity. Using corrections to the \${\textbackslash}Delta {\textbackslash}nu\$ scaling relation suggested by stellar models (available for download) significantly reduces the disagreement between predicted and observed masses. For a few cases where non-seismic mass estimates are available, the corrections to \${\textbackslash}Delta {\textbackslash}nu\$ also improve the agreement between seismic and non-seismic mass estimates. The disagreement between predictions of the Galactic model and the observations is most pronounced for stars with \$\{{\textbackslash}rm [Fe/H]\}{\textless}-0.5\$ and \$\{{\textbackslash}rm [Fe/H]\}{\textgreater}0\$ or for \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}{\textgreater}4700\$ K. Altering the star formation rate in order to suppress stars older than 10 Gyr improves the agreement for mass but leads to inconsistent color distributions. We also tested the predictions of the TRILEGAL Galactic model. However, unlike \{{\textbackslash}sl Galaxia\}, it had difficulties in reproducing the photometric properties of the Kepler Input Catalog because it overestimates the number of blue stars. We conclude that either the scaling relations and/or the Galactic models need to be revised to reconcile predictions of theory with asteroseismic observations.},

Explorer mission that will perform a wide-field survey for planets that
transit bright host stars. Here, we predict the properties of the
transiting planets that TESS will detect along with the EB stars that
produce false-positive photometric signals. The predictions are based on
Monte Carlo simulations of the nearby population of stars, occurrence
rates of planets derived from Kepler, and models for the photometric
performance and sky coverage of the TESS cameras. We expect that TESS
will find approximately 1700 transiting planets from 2×
\{10\}5 pre-selected target stars. This includes 556 planets
smaller than twice the size of Earth, of which 419 are hosted by M dwarf
stars and 137 are hosted by FGK dwarfs. Approximately 130 of the R{\textbackslash}lt 2
\{R\}{\textbackslash}oplus planets will have host stars brighter than
\{K\}s=9. Approximately 48 of the planets with R{\textbackslash}lt 2

planets larger than 4 \{R\}{\textbackslash}oplus . Additional planets larger
than 2 \{R\}{\textbackslash}oplus can be detected around stars that are not
among the pre-selected target stars, because TESS will also deliver
full-frame images at a 30-minute cadence. The planet detections are
accompanied by over 1000 astrophysical false positives. We discuss how
TESS data and ground-based observations can be used to distinguish the
false positives from genuine planets. We also discuss the prospects for
follow-up observations to measure the masses and atmospheres of the TESS

	abstract = {New insights on stellar evolution and stellar interiors physics are being made possible by asteroseismology. Throughout the course of the Kepler mission, asteroseismology has also played an important role in the characterization of exoplanet-host stars and their planetary systems. The upcoming NASA Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will be performing a near all-sky survey for planets that transit bright nearby stars. In addition, its excellent photometric precision, combined with its fine time sampling and long intervals of uninterrupted
observations, will enable asteroseismology of solar-type and red-giant stars. Here we develop a simple test to estimate the detectability of solar-like oscillations in TESS photometry of any given star. Based on an all-sky stellar and planetary synthetic population, we go on to predict the asteroseismic yield of the TESS mission, placing emphasis on the yield of exoplanet-host stars for which we expect to detect
solar-like oscillations. This is done for both the target stars
(observed at a 2-min cadence) and the full-frame-image stars (observed at a 30-min cadence). A similar exercise is also conducted based on a compilation of known host stars. We predict that TESS will detect solar-like oscillations in a few dozen target hosts (mainly subgiant stars but also in a smaller number of F dwarfs), in up to 200
low-luminosity red-giant hosts, and in over 100 solar-type and red-giant known hosts, thereby leading to a threefold improvement in the
asteroseismic yield of exoplanet-host stars when compared to Kepler's.},

the time series data as input and does not require any other input
information. Tests on 353 artificial stars reveal that we can obtain
accurate frequencies and oscillation parameters for about three quarters
of the stars. We conclude that our methods are well suited for the

presentations and discussion of key issues for instrumentation and data analysis and the workshop recommendations for achieving this precision are summarized here. Beginning with the HARPS spectrograph,
technological advances for precision radial velocity measurements have focused on building extremely stable instruments. To reach still higher precision, future spectrometers will need to produce even higher fidelity spectra. This should be possible with improved environmental control, greater stability in the illumination of the spectrometer optics, better detectors, more precise wavelength calibration, and broader bandwidth spectra. Key data analysis challenges for the
precision radial velocity community include distinguishing center of mass Keplerian motion from photospheric velocities, and the proper treatment of telluric contamination. Success here is coupled to the instrument design, but also requires the implementation of robust statistical and modeling techniques. Center of mass velocities produce Doppler shifts that affect every line identically, while photospheric velocities produce line profile asymmetries with wavelength and temporal dependencies that are different from Keplerian signals. Exoplanets are an important subfield of astronomy and there has been an impressive rate of discovery over the past two decades. Higher precision radial velocity measurements are required to serve as a discovery technique for
potentially habitable worlds and to characterize detections from transit missions. The future of exoplanet science has very different
trajectories depending on the precision that can ultimately be achieved with Doppler measurements.},

Comparing observations with theory should therefore improve our understanding of the underlying physics. However, theoretical models invariably compute oscillation amplitudes relative to the Sun, and it is therefore vital to have a good calibration of the solar amplitude using stellar techniques. We have used daytime spectra of the Sun, obtained with HARPS and UCLES, to measure the solar oscillations and made a detailed comparison with observations using the BiSON helioseismology instrument. We find that the mean solar amplitude measured using stellar techniques, averaged over one full solar cycle, is 18.7 +/- 0.7 cm/s for the strongest radial modes (l=0) and 25.2 +/- 0.9 cm/s for l=1. In addition, we use simulations to establish an equation that estimates the uncertainty of amplitude measurements that are made of other stars, given that the mode lifetime is known. Finally, we also give amplitudes of solar-like oscillations for three stars that we measured from a series of short observations with HARPS (gamma Ser, beta Aql and alpha For), together with revised amplitudes for five other stars for which we have previously published results (alpha Cen A, alpha Cen B, beta Hyi, nu Ind and delta Pav).},

Obtaining this contrast level and beyond requires the combination of a coronagraph to suppress light coming from the host star and a wavefront control system including a deformable mirror (DM) to remove residual starlight (speckles) created by the imperfections of telescope. However, all these current and future systems focus on detecting faint planets around single host stars, while several targets or planet candidates are located around nearby binary stars such as our neighboring star Alpha Centauri. Here, we present a method to simultaneously correct aberrations and diffraction of light coming from the target star as well as its companion star in order to reveal planets orbiting the target star.

In our simulations, radiation escapes from the base of a fireball trapped in a dipolar magnetic field, and is scattered through the optically thick magnetosphere of the magnetar until it escapes. Beaming is provided by the presence of a relativistic outflow, as well as by the geometry of the system. We find that a simple picture for the relativistic outflow is enough to create the pulse fraction and sharp peaks observed in pulse profiles of magnetar flares, while without a relativistic outflow the beaming is insufficient to explain giant flare rotational modulations.},

	abstract = {We measure the mass of a modestly irradiated giant planet, KOI-94d. We wish to determine whether this planet, which is in a 22 day orbit and receives 2700 times as much incident flux as Jupiter, is as dense as Jupiter or rarefied like inflated hot Jupiters. KOI-94 also hosts at least three smaller transiting planets, all of which were detected by the Kepler mission. With 26 radial velocities of KOI-94 from the W. M. Keck Observatory and a simultaneous fit to the Kepler light curve, we measure the mass of the giant planet and determine that it is not inflated. Support for the planetary interpretation of the other three candidates comes from gravitational interactions through transit timing variations, the statistical robustness of multi-planet systems against false positives, and several lines of evidence that no other star resides within the photometric aperture. We report the properties of KOI-94b (M P = 10.5 ± 4.6 M ⊕, R
P = 1.71 ± 0.16 R ⊕, P = 3.74 days),
KOI-94c (M P = 15.6{\textasciicircum}\{+5.7\}\_\{-15.6\} M ⊕, R
P = 4.32 ± 0.41 R ⊕, P = 10.4 days),
KOI-94d (M P = 106 ± 11 M ⊕, R
P = 11.27 ± 1.06 R ⊕, P = 22.3 days),
and KOI-94e (M P = 35{\textasciicircum}\{+18\}\_\{-28\} M ⊕, R
P = 6.56 ± 0.62 R ⊕, P = 54.3 days).
The radial velocity analyses of KOI-94b and KOI-94e offer marginal ({\textgreater}2σ) mass detections, whereas the observations of KOI-94c
offer only an upper limit to its mass. Using the KOI-94 system and other planets with published values for both mass and radius (138 exoplanets total, including 35 with M P {\textless} 150 M ⊕),
we establish two fundamental planes for exoplanets that relate their mass, incident flux, and radius from a few Earth masses up to 13 Jupiter masses: (R P/R ⊕) = 1.78(M P/M
⊕)0.53(F/erg s-1
cm-2)-0.03 for M P {\textless} 150
M ⊕, and R P/R ⊕ = 2.45(M
P/M ⊕)-0.039(F/erg
s-1 cm-2)0.094 for M
P {\textgreater} 150 M ⊕. These equations can be used
to predict the radius or mass of a planet.

We detected and confirmed four previously unknown stellar companions to the exoplanet hosts HD 197037, HD 217786,
Kepler-21 and Kepler-68. In addition, we detected 11 new low-mass stellar companion candidates which must still be confirmed as bound companions. We also provide new astrometric and photometric data points for the recently discovered very close binary systems WASP-76 and HD 2638. Furthermore, we show for the first time that the previously detected stellar companion to the HD 185269 system is a very low mass binary.

Observations of eclipses (transits and occultations) provide a bonanza of information that cannot be obtained from radial-velocity data alone, such as the relative dimensions of the planet and its host star, as well as the orientation of the planet's orbit relative to the sky plane and relative to the stellar rotation axis. The wavelength-dependence of the eclipse signal gives clues about the the temperature and composition of the planetary atmosphere. Anomalies in the timing or other properties of the eclipses may betray the presence of additional planets or moons. Searching for eclipses is also a productive means of discovering new planets. This chapter reviews the basic geometry and physics of eclipses, and summarizes the knowledge that has been gained through eclipse observations, as well as the information that might be gained in the future.},

	abstract = {We present a new geometrical method aimed at determining the members of open clusters. The methodology estimates, in an N-dimensional space, the membership probabilities by means of the distances between every star and the cluster central overdensity. It can handle different sets of variables, which have to satisfy the simple condition of being more densely distributed for the cluster members than for the field stars (as positions, proper motions, radial velocities and/or parallaxes are). Unlike other existing techniques, this fact makes the method more flexible and so can be easily applied to different datasets. To quantify how the method identifies the clus- ter members, we design series of realistic simulations recreating sky regions in both position and proper motion subspaces populated by clusters and field stars. The re- sults, using different simulated datasets (N = 1, 2 and 4 variables), show that the method properly recovers a very high fraction of simulated cluster members, with a low number of misclassified stars. To compare the goodness of our methodology, we also run other existing algorithms on the same simulated data. The results show that our method has a similar or even better performance than the other techniques. We study the robustness of the new methodology from different subsamplings of the ini- tial sample, showing a progressive deterioration of the capability of our method as the fraction of missing objects increases. Finally, we apply all the methodologies to the real cluster NGC 2682, indicating that our methodology is again in good agreement with preceding studies.},

	abstract = {Pulsating binary stars are ideal targets for testing the theory of stellar structure and evolution. Fundamental parameters can be derived from binary modelling to high precision and provide crucial constraints for seismic modelling. High-order gravity modes are sensitive to the conditions near the convective core and therefore allow for a determination of parameters describing interior physics, especially the convective-core overshooting parameter. KIC 10080943 is a binary system, which contains two gravity- and pressure-mode hybrid pulsators. A detailed observational study has provided fundamental and seismic parameters for both components. We aim to find a model, which is able to predict the observed g-mode period spacings and stellar parameters of both components of KIC 10080943. By calculating model grids with the stellar evolution code MESA and the seismic code GYRE, we can compare theoretical properties to the observed mean period spacing and position in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The masses of our best models are somewhat below the values estimated from binarity, which is a consequence of the low observed mean g-mode period spacing. We find that the amount of core overshooting and of diffusive mixing can be well constrained by the equal-age requirement for the two stars. However, we find no significant difference for different shapes of the core overshooting. The measured rotation rates are within the limit of validity for the first-order perturbation approximation. We can find a good fit by using the traditional approximation for the pulsations, when taking slightly younger models with a higher asymptotic period spacing. This is because the zonal modes experience a slight shift due to the Coriolis force, which the first-order perturbation approximation ignores.},

	abstract = {We consider the prospects for detecting solar-like oscillations in the "super-Nyquist" regime of long-cadence (LC) Kepler photometry, i.e., above the associated Nyquist frequency of approximately 283 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}Hz. Targets of interest are cool, evolved subgiants and stars lying at the base of the red-giant branch. These stars would ordinarily be studied using the short-cadence (SC) data, since the associated SC Nyquist frequency lies well above the frequencies of the detectable oscillations. However, the number of available SC target slots is quite limited. This imposes a severe restriction on the size of the ensemble available for SC asteroseismic study.We find that archival Kepler LC data from the nominal Mission may be utilized for asteroseismic studies of targets whose dominant oscillation frequencies lie as high as approximately 500 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}Hz, i.e., about 1.75- times the LC Nyquist frequency. The frequency detection threshold for the shorter-duration science campaigns of the re-purposed Kepler Mission, K2, is lower. The maximum threshold will probably lie somewhere between approximately 400 and 450 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}Hz. The potential to exploit the archival Kepler and K2 LC data in this manner opens the door to increasing significantly the number of subgiant and low-luminosity red-giant targets amenable to asteroseismic analysis, overcoming target limitations imposed by the small number of SC slots.We estimate that around 400 such targets are now available for study in the Kepler LC archive. That number could potentially be a lot higher for K2, since there will be a new target list for each of its campaigns.},

	abstract = {The advent of space-based observatories such as CoRoT and Kepler has enabled the testing of our understanding of stellar evolution on thousands of stars. Evolutionary models typically require five input parameters, the mass, initial Helium abundance, initial metallicity, mixing-length (assumed to be constant over time) and the age to which the star must be evolved. These parameters are also very useful in characterizing the associated planets and in studying galactic archaeology. How to obtain the parameters from observations rapidly and accurately, specifically in the context of surveys of thousands of stars, is an outstanding question, one that has eluded straightforward resolution. For a given star, we typically measure the effective temperature and surface metallicity spectroscopically and low-degree oscillation frequencies through space observatories. Here we demonstrate that statistical learning, using multi-layered neural networks, is successful in determining the evolutionary parameters based on spectroscopic and seismic measurements. Our trained networks show robustness over a broad range of parameter space, and critically, are entirely computationally inexpensive. This method is both computationally cheap and inferentially accurate, paving the way for analyzing the vast quantities of stellar observations from past, current and future missions.},

	abstract = {Estimating a distance by inverting a parallax is only valid in the 
absence of noise. As most stars in the Gaia catalogue will have
non-negligible fractional parallax errors, we must treat distance
estimation as a constrained inference problem. Here we investigate the
performance of various priors for estimating distances, using a
simulated Gaia catalogue of one billion stars. We use three minimalist,
isotropic priors, as well an anisotropic prior derived from the
observability of stars in a Milky Way model. The two priors that assume
a uniform distribution of stars--either in distance or in space
density---give poor results: The root mean square fractional distance
error, f\_RMS, grows far in excess of 100\% once the fractional parallax
error, f\_true, is larger than 0.1. A prior assuming an exponentially
decreasing space density with increasing distance performs well once its
single scale length parameter has been set to an appropriate value:
f\_RMS is roughly equal to f\_true for f\_true {\textless} 0.4, yet does not
increase further as f\_true increases up to to 1.0. The Milky Way prior
performs well except towards the Galactic centre, due to a mismatch with
the (simulated) data. Such mismatches will be inevitable (and remain
unknown) in real applications, and can produce large errors. We
therefore suggest to adopt the simpler exponentially decreasing space
density prior, which is also less time-consuming to compute. Including
Gaia photometry improves the distance estimation significantly for both
the Milky Way and exponentially decreasing space density prior, yet
doing so requires additional assumptions about the physical nature of
stars.},

In "The Music of the Sun", renowned helioseismologist William Chaplin tells the story of this discipline's origins and gives us invaluable insight into its implications - not only for better understanding the distant sun and stars, but also for cosmology, particle physics, and the very relationship between the Sun and the Earth.},

data that is becoming available in the SDSS photometric system it is
particularly important to be able to convert between this new system and
traditional photometric systems. Unlike earlier published
transformations we based our calculations on stars actually measured by
the SDSS with the SDSS 2.5-m telescope. The photometric database of the
SDSS provides in a sense a single-epoch set of "tertiary standards"
covering more than one quarter of the sky. Our transformations should
facilitate their use to easily and reliably derive the corresponding
approximate Johnson-Cousins or RGU magnitudes. Methods: .The SDSS
survey covers a number of areas that were previously established as
standard fields in the Johnson-Cousins system, in particular, fields
established by Landolt and by Stetson. We used these overlapping fields
to create well-photometered star samples on which our calculated
transformations are based. For the RGU photometry we used fields
observed in the framework of the new Basel high-latitude field star
survey. Results: .We calculated empirical color transformations
between SDSS photometry and Johnson-Cousins UBVRI and Becker's RGU
system. For all transformations we found linear relations to be
sufficient. Furthermore we showed that the transformations between the
Johnson-Cousins and the SDSS system have a slight dependence on
metallicity.},

	abstract = {The transit of a star by a dark companion or planet results in a characteristic colorimetric "signature," which should be detectable by photometric means. This signature, which is due to differential limb darkening in red and blue light, takes the form of a slight shift towards the blue as the planet crosses the limb of the star, followed by an abnormal reddening during the transit of the center region of the star, and finally another shift towards the blue as the planet
approaches the far limb. An analysis of this signature, the
probabilities of detecting such transits (using the solar system as a model), and possible instrumentation for this purpose are discussed. A system designed to yield one or more planetary detections per year is believed to be feasible at moderate cost. Such a system would consist of three wide-field telescopes, at well-separated sites, slaved to a central computer. Each telescope would be equipped with a two-color photometer employing an image dissector under computer control for tracking and rapid switching between program stars without requiring frequent resetting of the instrument. Each telescope would survey an independent sample of stars on a rapid rotation cycle, until one of the telescopes detected an unusual transient, at which time all three would be used to provide additional data and increased reliability as a coincidence detection system.},

The volume observed by surveys such as Gaia or near-infrared spectroscopic surveys, which have good coverage of the Galactic mid-plane region, is highly complex because of the abundant small-scale structure in the three-dimensional interstellar dust extinction. We introduce a novel framework for analyzing the importance of small-scale structure in the extinction. This formalism demonstrates that the spatially-complex effect of extinction on the selection function of a pencil-beam or contiguous sky survey is equivalent to a low-pass filtering of the extinction-affected selection function with the smooth density field. We find that the angular resolution of current 3D extinction maps is sufficient for analyzing Gaia sub-samples of millions of stars. However, the current distance resolution is inadequate and needs to be improved by an order of magnitude, especially in the inner Galaxy. We also present a practical and efficient method for properly taking the effect of extinction into account in analyses of Galactic structure through an effective selection function. We illustrate its use with the selection function of red-clump stars in APOGEE using and comparing a variety of current 3D extinction maps.},

We discuss how the high precision in these parameters will constrain the stellar properties of stellar radius, distance, mass and age. We show that high precision can be achieved in mass and hence age when values of the g-mode period spacing are available.

Despite much work and the high internal precision usually achieved,
systematic differences of order 100 K (or more) among various scales are
still present. We present an investigation based on the infrared flux
method aimed at assessing the source of such discrepancies and pin down
their origin. We break the impasse among different scales by using a
large set of solar twins, stars which are spectroscopically and
photometrically identical to the Sun, to set the absolute zero point of
the effective temperature scale to within few degrees. Our newly
calibrated, accurate and precise temperature scale applies to dwarfs and
subgiants, from super-solar metallicities to the most metal-poor stars
currently known. At solar metallicities our results validate
spectroscopic effective temperature scales, whereas for [Fe/H]⪉ -2.5
our temperatures are roughly 100 K hotter than those determined from
model fits to the Balmer lines and 200 K hotter than those obtained from
the excitation equilibrium of Fe lines. Empirical bolometric corrections
and useful relations linking photometric indices to effective
temperatures and angular diameters have been derived. Our results take
full advantage of the high accuracy reached in absolute calibration in
recent years and are further validated by interferometric angular
diameters and space based spectrophotometry over a wide range of
effective temperatures and metallicities.

	abstract = {Introducing the DRAGON simulation project, we present direct \$N\$-body simulations of four massive globular clusters (GCs) with \$10{\textasciicircum}6\$ stars and 5\${\textbackslash}\%\$ primordial binaries at a high level of accuracy and realism. The GC evolution is computed with NBODY6++GPU and follows the dynamical and stellar evolution of individual stars and binaries, kicks of neutron stars and black holes, and the effect of a tidal field. We investigate the evolution of the luminous (stellar) and dark (faint stars and stellar remnants) GC components and create mock observations of the simulations (i.e. photometry, color-magnitude diagrams, surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles). By connecting internal processes to observable features we highlight the formation of a long-lived 'dark' nuclear subsystem made of black holes (BHs), which results in a two-component structure. The inner core is dominated by the BH subsystem and experiences a core collapse phase within the first Gyr. It can be detected in the stellar (luminous) line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles. The outer extended core - commonly observed in the (luminous) surface brightness profiles - shows no collapse features and is continuously expanding. We demonstrate how a King (1966) model fit to observed clusters might help identify the presence of post core-collapse BH subsystems. For global observables like core and half-mass radii the direct simulations agree well with Monte-Carlo models. Variations in the initial mass function can result in significantly different GC properties (e.g. density distributions) driven by varying amounts of early mass loss and the number of forming BHs.},

first six quarters of Kepler data and reported by Batalha et al. (2013).
These data show 899 transiting planet candidates in 365 multiple-planet
systems and provide a powerful means to study the statistical properties
of planetary systems. Using a generic mass-radius relationship, we find
that only two pairs of planets in these candidate systems (out of 761
pairs total) appear to be on Hill-unstable orbits, indicating {\textasciitilde}96\% of
the candidate planetary systems are correctly interpreted as true
systems. We find that planet pairs show little statistical preference to
be near mean-motion resonances. We identify an asymmetry in the
distribution of period ratios near first-order resonances (e.g., 2:1,
3:2), with an excess of planet pairs lying wide of resonance and
relatively few lying narrow of resonance. Finally, based upon the
transit duration ratios of adjacent planets in each system, we find that
the interior planet tends to have a smaller transit impact parameter
than the exterior planet does. This finding suggests that the mode of
the mutual inclinations of planetary orbital planes is in the range
1.°0-2.°2, for the packed systems of small planets probed by
these observations.},

estimate the fundamental properties of more than 500 main-sequence and
sub-giant stars. Data obtained during the first 10 months of Kepler
science operations were used for this work, when these solar-type
targets were observed for one month each in survey mode. Stellar
properties have been estimated using two global asteroseismic parameters
and complementary photometric and spectroscopic data. Homogeneous sets
of effective temperatures, T eff, were available for the
entire ensemble from complementary photometry; spectroscopic estimates
of T eff and [Fe/H] were available from a homogeneous
analysis of ground-based data on a subset of 87 stars. We adopt a
grid-based analysis, coupling six pipeline codes to 11 stellar
evolutionary grids. Through use of these different grid-pipeline
combinations we allow implicitly for the impact on the results of
stellar model dependencies from commonly used grids, and differences in
adopted pipeline methodologies. By using just two global parameters as
the seismic inputs we are able to perform a homogenous analysis of all
solar-type stars in the asteroseismic cohort, including many targets for
which it would not be possible to provide robust estimates of individual
oscillation frequencies (due to a combination of low signal-to-noise
ratio and short dataset lengths). The median final quoted uncertainties
from consolidation of the grid-based analyses are for the full ensemble
(spectroscopic subset) approximately 10.8\% (5.4\%) in mass, 4.4\% (2.2\%)
in radius, 0.017 dex (0.010 dex) in log g, and 4.3\% (2.8\%) in mean
density. Around 36\% (57\%) of the stars have final age uncertainties
smaller than 1 Gyr. These ages will be useful for ensemble studies, but
should be treated carefully on a star-by-star basis. Future analyses
using individual oscillation frequencies will offer significant
improvements on up to 150 stars, in particular for estimates of the
ages, where having the individual frequency data is most important.},

attributed the movement of sunspots to rotation of the Sun in 1613. In
contrast to the Sun, whose surface can be resolved by small telescopes
or even the (protected) eye, we detect stars as point sources with no
spatial information. Numerous techniques have been developed to derive
information about stellar rotation. Unfortunately, most observational
data allow only for the surface rotational rate to be inferred. The
internal rotational profile, which has a great effect on the stellar
structure and evolution, remains hidden below the top layers of the star
- the essential is hidden to the eyes.

Asteroseismology allows us to "sense" indirectly deep below the stellar
surface. Oscillations that propagate through the star provide
information about the deep stellar interiors while they also distort the
stellar surface in characteristic patterns leading to detectable
brightness or velocity variations. Also, certain oscillation modes are
sensitive to internal rotation and carry information on how the star is
spinning deep inside. Thanks to the unprecedented quality of NASA's
space telescope Kepler, numerous detailed observations of stars in
various evolutionary stages are available. Such high quality data allow
that for many stars, rotation can not only be constrained from surface
rotation, but also investigated through seismic studies.

The work presented in this thesis focuses on the oscillations and
internal rotational gradient of evolved single and binary stars. It is
shown that the seismic analysis can reach the cores of oscillating
red-giant stars and that these cores are rapidly rotating, while nested
in a slowly rotating convective envelope.},

rotational splittings, lifetimes and amplitudes of low-l p modes. In
all, using both techniques, we managed to fit 18 modes (seven l = 0,
eight l = 1 and three l = 2) with frequencies determined to within 1-2
μHz. These estimates are shown to be 0.6 +/- 0.3 μHz lower, on
average, than the frequencies determined from two other more recent
studies, which used data gathered about 19 months after the WIRE
observations. This could be indicative of an activity cycle, although
due to the large uncertainty, more data would be needed to confirm this.

Over a range of 1700-2650 μHz, we were also able to use the ACF
fitting to determine an average lifetime of 3.9 +/- 1.4 d, and an
average rotational splitting of 0.54 +/- 0.22 μHz, which is the first
ever reliable estimate of this parameter. In contrast to the ACF, the
power spectrum fitting was shown to return significantly biased results

We assess the systematics from changes in the solar abundances and mixing-length parameter, showing that they are smaller than the statistical errors. We also determine the stellar properties with three other fitting algorithms and explore the systematics arising from using different evolution and pulsation codes, resulting in 1{\textbackslash}\% in density and radius, and 2{\textbackslash}\% and 7{\textbackslash}\% in mass and age, respectively. We confirm previous findings of the initial helium abundance being a source of systematics comparable to our statistical uncertainties, and discuss future prospects for constraining this parameter by combining asteroseismology and data from space missions. Finally we compare our derived properties with those obtained using the global average asteroseismic observables along with effective temperature and metallicity, finding an excellent level of agreement. Owing to selection effects, our results show that the majority of the high signal-to-noise ratio asteroseismic \{{\textbackslash}it Kepler\} host stars are older than the Sun.},

	abstract = {\% Ground based radial velocity (RV) searches continue to discover exoplanets below Neptune mass down to Earth mass. Furthermore,
ground-based transit searches now reach milli-mag photometric precision and can discover Neptune size planets around bright stars. These searches will find exoplanets around bright stars anywhere on the sky, their discoveries representing prime science targets for further study due to the proximity and brightness of their host stars. A mission for transit follow-up measurements of these prime targets is currently lacking. The first ESA S-class mission CHEOPS (CHaracterizing ExoPlanet Satellite) will fill this gap. It will perform ultra-high precision photometric monitoring of selected bright target stars almost anywhere on the sky with sufficient precision to detect Earth-sized transits. It will be able to detect transits of RV-planets by photometric monitoring if the geometric configuration results in a transit. For Hot Neptunes discovered from the ground, CHEOPS will be able to improve the transit light curve so that the radius can be determined precisely. Because of the host stars' brightness, high precision RV measurements will be possible for all targets. All planets observed in transit by CHEOPS will be validated and their masses will be known. This will provide valuable data for constraining the mass-radius relation of exoplanets, especially in the Neptune-mass regime. During the planned 3.5 year mission, about 500 targets will be observed. There will be 20\% of open time available for the community to develop new science programmes.},

radii up to R P = 1.5 R ⊕ increase in
density with increasing radius. Above 1.5 R ⊕, the
average planet density rapidly decreases with increasing radius, indicating that these planets have a large fraction of volatiles by volume overlying a rocky core. Including the solar system terrestrial planets with the exoplanets below 1.5 R ⊕, we find
ρP = 2.43 + 3.39(R P/R ⊕) g

planet masses to the fit between 1.5 and 4 R ⊕ is 4.3 M ⊕ with reduced χ2 = 6.2. The large

in many solar-type stars, thereby providing a way to probe the stars
using asteroseismology. Aims: We provide the mode linewidths and
mode heights of the oscillations of various stars as a function of
frequency and of effective temperature. Methods: We used a time
series of nearly two years of data for each star. The 23 stars observed
belong to the simple or F-like category. The power spectra of the 23
main-sequence stars were analysed using both maximum likelihood
estimators and Bayesian estimators, providing individual mode
characteristics such as frequencies, linewidths, and mode heights. We
study the source of systematic errors in the mode linewidths and mode
heights, and we present a way to correct these errors with respect to a
common reference fit. Results: Using the correction, we can
explain all sources of systematic errors, which could be reduced to less
than ±15\% for mode linewidths and heights, and less than
±5\% for amplitude, when compared to the reference fit. The effect
of a different estimated stellar background and a different estimated
splitting will provide frequency-dependent systematic errors that might
affect the comparison with theoretical mode linewidth and mode height,
therefore affecting the understanding of the physical nature of these
parameters. All other sources of relative systematic errors are less
dependent upon frequency. We also provide the dependence of the
so-called linewidth dip in the middle of the observed frequency range as
a function of effective temperature. We show that the depth of the dip
decreases with increasing effective temperature. The dependence of the
dip on effective temperature may imply that the mixing length parameter
α or the convective flux may increase with effective temperature.

For 4 CVn, the XCOV13 campaign has revealed 34 frequencies, which sets a new record for delta Scuti stars. Preliminary mode identifications are presented, indicating pulsation in low radial order and low degree (l = 0 to 2). The star shows strong amplitude variability with timescales of ten years or longer, although for neighbouring years the amplitudes usually are similar. The cyclic behavior of the amplitude variations excludes an evolutionary origin. The pulsation mode at 7.375 c/d exhibits the most rapid decrease found so far: the V amplitude dropped from the highest known value of 15 mmag in 1974 to 4 mmag in 1976 and 1 mmag in 1977. After that the mode has been increasing in amplitude. There exists a phase jump between 1976 and 1977, suggesting the growth of a new mode.},

Estimating distances is an inference problem in which the use of prior assumptions is
unavoidable. I investigate the properties and performance of various priors and examine their implications. A supposed uninformative uniform prior in distance is shown to give very poor distance estimates (large bias and variance). Any prior with a sharp cut-off at some distance has similar problems. The choice of prior depends on the information one has available—and is willing to use—concerning, e.g., the survey
and the Galaxy. I demonstrate that a simple prior which decreases asymptotically to zero at infinite distance has good performance, accommodates nonpositive parallaxes, and does not require a bias correction.},

	abstract = {PLATO 2.0 has recently been selected for ESA's M3 launch opportunity (2022/24). Providing accurate key planet parameters (radius, mass, density and age) in statistical numbers, it addresses fundamental questions such as: How do planetary systems form and evolve? Are there other systems with planets like ours, including potentially habitable planets? The PLATO 2.0 instrument consists of 34 small aperture
telescopes (32 with 25 s readout cadence and 2 with 2.5 s candence) providing a wide field-of-view (2232 deg 2) and a large photometric magnitude range (4-16 mag). It focusses on bright (4-11 mag) stars in wide fields to detect and characterize planets down to
Earth-size by photometric transits, whose masses can then be determined by ground-based radial-velocity follow-up measurements. Asteroseismology will be performed for these bright stars to obtain highly accurate stellar parameters, including masses and ages. The combination of bright targets and asteroseismology results in high accuracy for the bulk planet parameters: 2 \%, 4-10 \% and 10 \% for planet radii, masses and ages, respectively. The planned baseline observing strategy includes two long pointings (2-3 years) to detect and bulk characterize planets reaching into the habitable zone (HZ) of solar-like stars and an additional step-and-stare phase to cover in total about 50 \% of the sky. PLATO 2.0 will observe up to 1,000,000 stars and detect and characterize hundreds of small planets, and thousands of planets in the Neptune to gas giant regime out to the HZ. It will therefore provide the first large-scale catalogue of bulk characterized planets with accurate radii, masses, mean densities and ages. This catalogue will include terrestrial planets at intermediate orbital distances, where surface temperatures are moderate. Coverage of this parameter range with statistical numbers of bulk characterized planets is unique to PLATO 2.0. The PLATO 2.0 catalogue allows us to e.g.: - complete our knowledge of planet
diversity for low-mass objects, - correlate the planet mean
density-orbital distance distribution with predictions from planet formation theories,- constrain the influence of planet migration and scattering on the architecture of multiple systems, and - specify how planet and system parameters change with host star characteristics, such as type, metallicity and age. The catalogue will allow us to study planets and planetary systems at different evolutionary phases. It will further provide a census for small, low-mass planets. This will serve to identify objects which retained their primordial hydrogen atmosphere and in general the typical characteristics of planets in such low-mass, low-density range. Planets detected by PLATO 2.0 will orbit bright stars and many of them will be targets for future atmosphere spectroscopy exploring their atmosphere. Furthermore, the mission has the potential to detect exomoons, planetary rings, binary and Trojan planets. The planetary science possible with PLATO 2.0 is complemented by its impact on stellar and galactic science via asteroseismology as well as light curves of all kinds of variable stars, together with observations of stellar clusters of different ages. This will allow us to improve stellar models and study stellar activity. A large number of well-known ages from red giant stars will probe the structure and evolution of our Galaxy. Asteroseismic ages of bright stars for different phases of stellar evolution allow calibrating stellar age-rotation relationships. Together with the results of ESA's Gaia mission, the results of PLATO 2.0 will provide a huge legacy to planetary, stellar and galactic science.},

stars by the following constraints, which are not used in previous
transformations: (1) the data are dereddened, (2) giants are omitted and
(3) the sample stars selected are of the highest quality. We give
metallicity, population type and transformations dependent on two
colours. The transformations provide absolute magnitude and distance
determinations which can be used in space density evaluations at short
distances where some or all of the SDSS ugriz magnitudes are saturated.
The combination of these densities with those evaluated at larger
distances using SDSS ugriz photometry will supply accurate Galactic
model parameters, particularly the local space densities for each

We discussed the effects of changing the age \$t\_0\$ at which the accretion episode occurs, the mass of the ingested planet and its chemical composition. We showed that the mass of the ingested planet required to explain the current [Fe/H]{\textasciicircum}\#52 increases by decreasing the age \$t\_0\$ and/or by decreasing the Iron content of the accreted matter. We compared the predictions of a simplified accretion method -- where only the variation of the surface chemical composition is considered -- with that of a full accretion model that properly accounts for the modification of the stellar structure. We showed that the two approaches result in different convective envelope extension which can vary up to 10 percent. We discussed the impact of the planet ingestion on a stellar model in the colour-magnitude diagram, showing that a maximum shift of about 0.06 dex in the colour and 0.07 dex in magnitude are expected and that such variations persist even much later the accretion episode. We also analysed the systematic bias in the stellar mass and age inferred by using a grid of standard non accreting models to recover the characteristics of an accreting star. We found that standard non accreting models can safely be adopted for mass estimate, as the bias is {\textless}= 6 percent, while much more caution should be used for age estimate where the differences can reach about 60 percent.},

In this framework, scaling laws between asteroseismic quantities and stellar parameters are becoming essential tools to study a rich variety of stars. However, the physical underlying mechanisms of those scaling laws are still poorly known. Our objective is to provide a theoretical basis for the scaling between the frequency of the maximum in the power spectrum
(νmax) of solar-like oscillations and the cut-off
frequency (νc). Using the SoHO GOLF observations together with theoretical considerations, we first confirm that the maximum of the height in oscillation power spectrum is determined by the so-called plateau of the damping rates. The physical origin of the plateau can be traced to the destabilizing effect of the Lagrangian perturbation of entropy in the upper-most layers, which becomes important when the modal period and the local thermal relaxation time-scale are comparable. Based on this analysis, we then find a linear relation between
νmax and νc, with a coefficient that depends on the ratio of the Mach number of the exciting turbulence to the third power to the mixing-length parameter.},

the stellar photometry of any Galaxy field. The code attempts to improve
upon several technical aspects of star count models, by: dealing with
very complete input libraries of evolutionary tracks; using a stellar
spectral library to simulate the photometry in virtually any broad-band
system; being very versatile allowing easy changes in the input
libraries and in the description of all of its ingredients - like the
star formation rate, age-metallicity relation, initial mass function,
and geometry of Galaxy components. In a previous paper (Groenewegen et
al. 2002, Paper I), the code was first applied to describe the very deep
star counts of the CDFS stellar catalogue. Here, we briefly describe its
initial calibration using EIS-deep and DMS star counts, which, as we
show, are adequate samples to probe both the halo and the disc
components of largest scale heights (oldest ages). We then present the
changes in the calibration that were necessary to cope with some
improvements in the model input data, and the use of more extensive
photometry datasets: now the code is shown to successfully simulate also
the relatively shallower 2MASS catalogue, which probes mostly the disc
at intermediate ages, and the immediate solar neighbourhood as sampled
by Hipparcos - in particular its absolute magnitude versus colour
diagram -, which contains a somewhat larger fraction of younger stars
than deeper surveys. Remarkably, the same model calibration can
reproduce well the star counts in all the above-mentioned data sets,
that span from the very deep magnitudes of CDFS (16},

	abstract = {We infer distances and their asymmetric uncertainties for two million stars using the parallaxes published in the Gaia DR1 (GDR1) catalogue. We do this with two distance priors: A minimalist, isotropic prior assuming an exponentially decreasing space density with increasing distance, and an anisotropic prior derived from the observability of stars in a Milky Way model. We validate our results by comparing our distance estimates for 105 Cepheids which have more precise, independently estimated distances. For this sample we find that the Milky Way prior performs better (the RMS of the scaled residuals is 0.40) than the exponentially decreasing space density prior (RMS is 0.57), although for distances beyond 2 kpc the Milky Way prior performs worse, with a bias in the scaled residuals of -0.36 (vs. -0.07 for the exponentially decreasing space density prior). We do not attempt to include the photometric data in GDR1 due to the lack of reliable colour information. Our distance catalogue is available at http://www.mpia.de/homes/calj/tgas distances/main.html as well as at CDS. This should only be used to give individual distances.

This has been interpreted as evidence that hot-Jupiter formation is linked to dynamical disruption, as opposed to planet migration through a protoplanetary disk. We used asteroseismology to measure a large obliquity for Kepler-56, a red giant star hosting two transiting coplanar planets. These observations show that spin-orbit misalignments are not confined to hot-Jupiter systems. Misalignments in a broader class of systems had been predicted as a consequence of torques from wide-orbiting companions, and indeed radial velocity measurements revealed a third companion in a wide orbit in the Kepler-56 system.},

Kepler long-cadence photometry. The sample includes stars ranging in
evolution from the lower part of the red giant branch to the helium main
sequence. We investigate the relation between the large frequency
separation (Δν) and the frequency of maximum power
(νmax) and show that it is different for red giants than
for main-sequence stars, which is consistent with evolutionary models
and scaling relations. The distributions of νmax and
Δν are in qualitative agreement with a simple stellar
population model of the Kepler field, including the first evidence for a
secondary clump population characterized by M {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 2 M sun
and νmax {\textasciitilde}= 40-110 μHz. We measured the small frequency
separations δν02 and δν01 in
over 400 stars and δν03 in over 40. We present C-D
diagrams for l = 1, 2, and 3 and show that the frequency separation
ratios δν02/Δν and
δν01/Δν have opposite trends as a function
of Δν. The data show a narrowing of the l = 1 ridge toward
lower νmax, in agreement with models predicting more
efficient mode trapping in stars with higher luminosity. We investigate
the offset epsilon in the asymptotic relation and find a clear
correlation with Δν, demonstrating that it is related to
fundamental stellar parameters. Finally, we present the first
amplitude-νmax relation for Kepler red giants. We observe
a lack of low-amplitude stars for νmax {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 110 μHz
and find that, for a given νmax between 40 and 110 μHz,
stars with lower Δν (and consequently higher mass) tend to show
lower amplitudes than stars with higher Δν.},

	abstract = {Aims.The Two Micron All Sky Survey, along with the Stellar Population Synthesis Model of the Galaxy, developed in Besançon, is used to calculate the extinction distribution along different lines of sight. By combining many lines of sight, the large scale distribution of
interstellar material can be deduced.Methods.The Galaxy model is used to provide the intrinsic colour of stars and their probable distances, so that the near infrared colour excess, and hence the extinction, may be calculated and its distance evaluated. Such a technique is dependent on the model used, however we are able to show that moderate changes in the model parameters result in insignificant changes in the predicted extinction. Results.This technique has now been applied to over 64 000 lines of sight, each separated by 15´, in the inner Galaxy ({\textbar}l{\textbar}≤ 100°, {\textbar}b{\textbar}≤ 10°). We
have projected our three dimensional results onto a two dimensional plane in order to compare them with existing two dimensional extinction maps and CO surveys. We find that although differences exist due to the different methods used or the medium traced, the same large scale structures are visible in each of the different maps. Using our
extinction map, we have derived the main characteristics of the large scale structure of the dust distribution. The scale height of the interstellar matter is found to be 125+17-7 pc. The dust distribution is found to be asymmetrically warped, in agreement with CO and HI observations of the ISM. However, the slope of the dust warp and the galactocentric distance where it starts are found to be smaller than the values measured for the external HI disc: for positive longitudes the angle is θ= 89°, it starts at 8.7 kpc from the
Galactic center and grows with a slope of 0.14, while at negative longitudes, the angle of the maximum is at θ= 272°, the
starting radius 7.8 kpc and the slope 0.11. Finally, the presence of dust is detected in the Galactic bulge. It forms an elongated structure approximately 5.2 kpc long and lies at an angle of 30 ± 5°
with respect to the Sun-Galactic centre direction. This may be
interpreted as a dust lane along the Galactic bar. This resulting extinction map will be useful for studies of the inner Galaxy and its stellar populations.},

During its two-year mission, TESS will employ four wide-field optical CCD cameras to monitor at least 200,000 main-sequence dwarf stars with I = 4-13 for temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transits. Each star will be observed for an interval ranging from one month to one year, depending mainly on the star's ecliptic latitude. The longest observing intervals will be for stars near the ecliptic poles, which are the optimal locations for follow-up observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. Brightness measurements of preselected target stars will be recorded every 2 min, and full frame images will be recorded every 30 min. TESS stars will be 10-100 times brighter than those surveyed by the pioneering Kepler mission. This will make TESS planets easier to characterize with follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more than a thousand planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are comparable in size to the Earth. Public data releases will occur every four months, inviting immediate community-wide efforts to study the new planets.

kiloparsecs, based on Pan-STARRS 1 (PS1) and 2MASS photometry. The map reveals a wealth of detailed structure, from filaments to large cloud complexes. The map has a hybrid angular resolution, with most of the map at an angular resolution of 3{\textbackslash}buildrel\{ {\textbackslash}prime\}{\textbackslash}over\{.\}
4-13{\textbackslash}buildrel\{ {\textbackslash}prime\}{\textbackslash}over\{.\} 7, and a maximum distance
resolution of ˜ 25\%. The three-dimensional distribution of dust is determined in a fully probabilistic framework, yielding the uncertainty in the reddening distribution along each line of sight, as well as stellar distances, reddenings, and classifications for 800 million stars detected by PS1. We demonstrate the consistency of our reddening estimates with those of two-dimensional emission-based maps of dust reddening. In particular, we find agreement with the Planck \{\vphantom{\}}τ
\vphantom{\{}\}353\{GHz\}-based reddening map to within 0.05 \{mag\} in E(B-V) to a depth of 0.5 \{mag\}, and explore systematics at reddenings less than E(B-V)≈ 0.08 \{mag\}. We validate our per-star reddening estimates by comparison with reddening estimates for stars with both Sloan Digital Sky Survey photometry and Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration spectral classifications, finding per-star agreement to within 0.1 \{mag\} out to a stellar E(B-V) of 1 mag. We compare our map to two existing three-dimensional dust maps, by Marshall et al. and Lallement et al., demonstrating our finer angular resolution, and better distance resolution compared to the former within ˜ 3 \{kpc\}. The map
can be queried or downloaded at http://argonaut.skymaps.info. We
expect the three-dimensional reddening map presented here to find a wide
range of uses, among them correcting for reddening and extinction for
objects embedded in the plane of the Galaxy, studies of Galactic
structure, calibration of future emission-based dust maps, and
determining distances to objects of known reddening.},

	abstract = {Context. The long and almost continuous observations by Kepler show 
clear evidence of a granulation background signal in a large sample of
stars, which is interpreted as the surface manifestation of convection.
It has been shown that its characteristic timescale and rms intensity
fluctuation scale with the peak frequency (νmax) of the
solar-like oscillations. Various attempts have been made to quantify the
observed signal, to determine scaling relations for its characteristic
parameters, and to compare them to theoretical predictions. Even though
they are consistent on a global scale, large systematic differences of
an unknown origin remain between different methods, as well as between
the observations and simulations. Aims: We aim to study different
approaches to quantifying the signature of stellar granulation and to
search for a unified model that reproduces the observed signal best in a
wide variety of stars. We then aim to define empirical scaling relations
between the granulation properties and νmax and various
other stellar parameters. Methods: We use a probabilistic method
to compare different approaches to extracting the granulation signal. We
fit the power density spectra of a large set of Kepler targets,
determine the granulation and global oscillation parameter, and quantify
scaling relations between them. Results: We establish that a
depression in power at about νmax/2, known from the Sun
and a few other main-sequence stars, is also statistically significant
in red giants and that a super-Lorentzian function with two components
is best suited to reproducing the granulation signal in the broader
vicinity of the pulsation power excess. We also establish that the
specific choice of the background model can affect the determination of
νmax, introducing systematic uncertainties that can
significantly exceed the random uncertainties. We find the
characteristic frequency (i.e., inverse timescale) and amplitude of both
background components to tightly scale with νmax for a
wide variety of stars (about 2-2000 μHz in νmax), and
quantify a mass dependency of the latter. To enable comparison with
theoretical predictions (which do not include the observed power
depression), we computed effective timescales and bolometric intensity
fluctuations and found them to approximately scale as
τeff ∝ g-0.85T-0.4 and
Agran ∝ (g2M)- 1/4 (or more
conveniently R/M3/4), respectively. Similarly, the bolometric
pulsation amplitude scales approximately as Apuls ∝
(g2M)- 1/3 (or R4/3/M), which
implicitly verifies a separate mass and luminosity dependence of
Apuls. We have also checked our scaling relations with solar
reference values and find them in good agreement. Conclusions: We
provide a thorough analysis of the granulation background signal in a
large sample of stars, from which we establish a unified model that
allows us to accurately extract the granulation and global oscillation
parameter. The resulting scaling relations allow a simple estimate of
the overall spectral shape of any solar-type oscillator and might serve
as a starting point for future large-sample studies or as a reference
for theoretical modelling of granulation.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of observational data on the p-mode spectrum of the star α Cen B, and a comparison with theoretical
computations of the stochastic excitation and damping of the modes. We find that at frequencies gsim4500 μHz, the model damping rates appear to be too weak to explain the observed shape of the power spectral density of α Cen B. The conclusion rests on the assumption that
most of the disagreement is due to problems modeling the damping rates, not the excitation rates, of the modes. This assumption is supported by a parallel analysis of BiSON Sun-as-a-star data, for which it is possible to use analysis of very long timeseries to place tight
constraints on the assumption. The BiSON analysis shows that there is a similar high-frequency disagreement between theory and observation in the Sun. We demonstrate that by using suitable comparisons of theory and observation it is possible to make inference on the dependence of the p-mode linewidths on frequency, without directly measuring those linewidths, even though the α Cen B dataset is only a few nights long. Use of independent measures from a previous study of the α Cen B linewidths in two parts of its spectrum also allows us to
calibrate our linewidth estimates for the star. The resulting calibrated linewidth curve looks similar to a frequency-scaled version of its solar cousin, with the scaling factor equal to the ratio of the respective acoustic cut-off frequencies of the two stars. The ratio of the
frequencies at which the onset of high-frequency problems is seen in both stars is also given approximately by the same scaling factor.},

A novel scheme was applied to determine \${\textbackslash}Delta {\textbackslash}nu\$ for 108 stars with \${\textbackslash}nu\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}\$ close to the Nyquist frequency (240\${\textbackslash}mu\$Hz {\textless} \${\textbackslash}nu\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}\$ {\textless} 320\${\textbackslash}mu\$Hz). Additionally, we identified 47 stars oscillating in the super-Nyquist frequency regime, up to 387\${\textbackslash}mu\$Hz, using long-cadence light curves. We show that the misclassifications are most likely due to large uncertainties in KIC surface gravities, and do not result from the absence of broadband colors or from different physical properties such as reddening, spatial distribution, mass or metallicity. The sample will be valuable to study oscillations in low-luminosity red giants and to characterize planet candidates around those stars.},

New insights on stellar evolution and stellar interiors physics are being made possible by asteroseismology, the study of stars by the observation of natural, resonant oscillations. Asteroseismology is proving to be particularly significant for the study of solar-type and red-giant stars. These stars show rich spectra of solar-like oscillations, which are excited and intrinsically damped by turbulence in the outermost layers of the convective envelopes. In this review we discuss the current state of the field, with a particular emphasis on recent advances provided by the Kepler and COROT (Convection, Rotation \& Planetary Transits) space missions and the wider significance to astronomy of the results from asteroseismology, such as stellar
populations studies and exoplanet studies.},

	abstract = {The AAVSO has been funded by the Robert Martin Ayers Sciences Fund to perform a wide-field, all-sky photometric survey. The survey will be conducted in the Johnson B and V and Sloan g', r' and i' filters, and primarily cover the 10-17th magnitude range. The brightness range was specifically chosen to complement the UCAC astrometric catalog. Precise, reliable standardized photometry for this magnitude range is in high demand and would allow many research programs to quickly establish transformations between systems and efficiently achieve conversion of photometry to more fundamental physical properties. Initial tests of the survey system are underway in New Mexico, with the far northern
declinations to be covered during 2009 and the remainder of the sky to be observed from Chile in 2010. The paper will present test information regarding the equipment, data pipelines for processing the 20GB/day data flow, time-lines for data products, and will describe how to access the photometry from the AAVSO web site as it becomes available.},

	abstract = {The new reduction of the Hipparcos data presents a very significant improvement in the overall reliability of the astrometric catalogue derived from this mission. Improvements by up to a factor 4 in the accuracies for in particular brighter stars have been obtained. This has been achieved mainly through careful study of the satellite dynamics, and incorporating results from these studies in the attitude modelling. Data correlations, caused by attitude-modelling errors in the original catalogue, have all but disappeared. This book provides overviews of the new reduction as well as on the use of the Hipparcos data in a variety of astrophysical implementations. A range of new results, like cluster distances and luminosity calibrations, is presented. The Hipparcos data provide a unique opportunity for the study of satellite dynamics. The orbit covered a wide range of altitudes, showing in detail the different torques acting on the satellite. One part of the book details these studies and their impact on the new reduction. It furthermore presents an extensive summary on a wide range of spacecraft and payload
calibrations, which provide a detailed record of the conditions under which these unique Hipparcos data have been obtained. The book is accompanied by a DVD with the new catalogue and the underlying data.

of using the positions from the Tycho-2 Catalogue as additional
information for a joint solution with early Gaia data. We call this the
Tycho-Gaia astrometric solution (TGAS). Methods: We adapt Gaia's
Astrometric Global Iterative Solution (AGIS) to incorporate Tycho
information, and use simulated Gaia observations to demonstrate the
feasibility of TGAS and to estimate its performance. Results:
Using six to twelve months of Gaia data, TGAS could deliver positions,
parallaxes, and annual proper motions for the 2.5 million Tycho-2 stars,
with sub-milliarcsecond accuracy. TGAS overcomes some of the limitations
of the HTPM project and allows its execution half a year earlier.
Furthermore, if the parallaxes from Hipparcos are not incorporated in
the solution, they can be used as a consistency check of the TGAS/HTPM
results.},

	doi = {10.1051/0004-6361/201629512},
	abstract = {Context. At about 1000 days after the launch of Gaia we present the 
first Gaia data release, Gaia DR1, consisting of astrometry and
photometry for over 1 billion sources brighter than magnitude 20.7. Aims: A summary of Gaia DR1 is presented along with illustrations of
the scientific quality of the data, followed by a discussion of the
limitations due to the preliminary nature of this release. 
Methods: The raw data collected by Gaia during the first 14 months of
the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis
Consortium (DPAC) and turned into an astrometric and photometric
catalogue. Results: Gaia DR1 consists of three components: a
primary astrometric data set which contains the positions, parallaxes,
and mean proper motions for about 2 million of the brightest stars in
common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues - a realisation of the
Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) - and a secondary astrometric
data set containing the positions for an additional 1.1 billion sources.
The second component is the photometric data set, consisting of mean
G-band magnitudes for all sources. The G-band light curves and the
characteristics of 3000 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, observed at high
cadence around the south ecliptic pole, form the third component. For
the primary astrometric data set the typical uncertainty is about 0.3
mas for the positions and parallaxes, and about 1 mas yr-1
for the proper motions. A systematic component of 0.3 mas should be
added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of 94 000 Hipparcos
stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more precise
at about 0.06 mas yr-1. For the secondary astrometric data
set, the typical uncertainty of the positions is 10 mas. The median
uncertainties on the mean G-band magnitudes range from the mmag level to
0.03 mag over the magnitude range 5 to 20.7. Conclusions: Gaia
DR1 is an important milestone ahead of the next Gaia data release, which
will feature five-parameter astrometry for all sources. Extensive
validation shows that Gaia DR1 represents a major advance in the mapping
of the heavens and the availability of basic stellar data that underpin
observational astrophysics. Nevertheless, the very preliminary nature of
this first Gaia data release does lead to a number of important
limitations to the data quality which should be carefully considered
before drawing conclusions from the data.},

acoustical energy generation by turbulent convection (the Lighthill mechanism) and linear damping. Convection is treated with a
time-dependent, nonlocal, mixing-length model, which includes both convective heat flux and turbulent pressure in both the equilibrium model and the pulsations. Velocity and luminosity amplitudes are computed for stars with masses between 0.9 M\_sun and 2.0 M\_sun in the vicinity of the main sequence, for various metallicities and convection parameters. As in previous studies, the amplitudes are found to increase with stellar mass, and therefore with luminosity. Amongst those stars that are pulsationally stable, the largest amplitudes are predicted for a 1.6 M\_sun model of spectral type F2; the values are approximately 15 times larger than those measured in the Sun.},

NASA Kepler mission. Long and continuous photometric observations of
unprecedented quality are now available which have stimulated the
development of a number of suites of innovative analysis tools. 
Aims: The power spectra of solar-like oscillations are an inexhaustible
source of information on stellar structure and evolution. Robust methods
are hence needed in order to infer both individual oscillation mode
parameters and parameters describing non-resonant features, thus making
a seismic interpretation possible. Methods: We present a
comprehensive guide to the implementation of a Bayesian peak-bagging
tool that employs a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Besides making it
possible to incorporate relevant prior information through Bayes'
theorem, this tool also allows one to obtain the marginal probability
density function for each of the fitted parameters. We apply this tool
to a couple of recent asteroseismic data sets, namely, to CoRoT
observations of HD 49933 and to ground-based
observations made during a campaign devoted to
Procyon. Results: The developed method
performs remarkably well at constraining not only in the traditional
case of extracting oscillation frequencies, but also when pushing the
limit where traditional methods have difficulties. Moreover it provides
an rigorous way of comparing competing models, such as the ridge
identifications, against the asteroseismic data.},

	abstract = {The peak bagging analysis, namely the fitting and identification of 
single oscillation modes in stars' power spectra, coupled to the very
high-quality light curves of red giant stars observed by Kepler, can
play a crucial role for studying stellar oscillations of different
flavor with an unprecedented level of detail. A thorough study of
stellar oscillations would thus allow for deeper testing of stellar
structure models and new insights in stellar evolution theory. However,
peak bagging inferences are in general very challenging problems due to
the large number of observed oscillation modes, hence of free parameters
that can be involved in the fitting models. Efficiency and robustness in
performing the analysis is what may be needed to proceed further. For
this purpose, we developed a new code implementing the Nested Sampling
Monte Carlo (NSMC) algorithm, a powerful statistical method well suited
for Bayesian analyses of complex problems. In this talk we show the peak
bagging of a sample of high signal-to-noise red giant stars by
exploiting recent Kepler datasets and a new criterion for the detection
of an oscillation mode based on the computation of the Bayesian
evidence. Preliminary results for frequencies and lifetimes for single
oscillation modes, together with acoustic glitches, are therefore
presented.},

	abstract = {Context. A growing number of solar-like oscillations has been detected 
in red giant stars thanks to the CoRoT and Kepler space-crafts. In the
same way as for main-sequence stars, mode driving is attributed to
turbulent convection in the uppermost convective layers of those stars.
 Aims: The seismic data gathered by CoRoT on red giant stars allow
us to test the mode driving theory in physical conditions different from
main-sequence stars. Methods: Using a set of 3D hydrodynamical
models representative of the upper layers of sub- and red giant stars,
we computed the acoustic mode energy supply rate (\{p\_max\}). Assuming
adiabatic pulsations and using global stellar models that assume that
the surface stratification comes from the 3D hydrodynamical models, we
computed the mode amplitude in terms of surface velocity. This was
converted into intensity fluctuations using either a simplified
adiabatic scaling relation or a non-adiabatic one. Results: From
L and M (the luminosity and mass), the energy supply rate \{p\_max\} is
found to scale as (L/M)2.6 for both main-sequence and red
giant stars, extending previous results. The theoretical amplitudes in
velocity under-estimate the Doppler velocity measurements obtained so
far from the ground for red giant stars by about 30\%. In terms of
intensity, the theoretical scaling law based on the adiabatic
intensity-velocity scaling relation results in an under-estimation by a
factor of about 2.5 with respect to the CoRoT seismic measurements. On
the other hand, using the non-adiabatic intensity-velocity relation
significantly reduces the discrepancy with the CoRoT data. The
theoretical amplitudes remain 40\% below, however, the CoRoT
measurements. Conclusions: Our results show that scaling
relations of mode amplitudes cannot be simply extended from
main-sequence to red giant stars in terms of intensity on the basis of
adiabatic relations because non-adiabatic effects for red giant stars
are important and cannot be neglected. We discuss possible reasons for
the remaining differences.},

˜3300 μHz, and we find that data for some targets are good enough
to allow for a measurement of the rotational splitting. Modeling of the
extracted parameters is performed by using grid-based methods using
average parameters and individual frequencies together with
spectroscopic parameters. For the target selection in C3, stars were
chosen as in C1 and C2 to cover a wide range in parameter space to
better understand the performance and noise characteristics. For C3 we
still detected oscillations in 73\% of the observed stars that we
proposed. Future K2 campaigns hold great promise for the study of nearby
clusters and the chemical evolution and age-metallicity relation
of nearby field stars in the solar neighborhood. We expect oscillations
to be detected in ˜388 SC targets if the K2 mission continues until
C18, which will greatly complement the ˜500 detections of solar-like
oscillations made for SC targets during the nominal Kepler mission. For
˜30-40 of these, including several members of the Hyades open

of stars and Kepler is an excellent observing facility to perform
asteroseismology. Here we select a sample of 35 Kepler solar-type stars
which host transiting exoplanets (or planet candidates) with detected
solar-like oscillations. Using available Kepler short cadence data up to
Quarter 16 we create power spectra optimized for asteroseismology of
solar-type stars. We identify modes of oscillation and estimate mode
frequencies by `peak bagging' using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo
framework. In addition, we expand the methodology of quality assurance
using a Bayesian unsupervised machine learning approach. We report the
measured frequencies of the modes of oscillation for all 35 stars and
frequency ratios commonly used in detailed asteroseismic modelling. Due
to the high correlations associated with frequency ratios we report the
covariance matrix of all frequencies measured and frequency ratios
calculated. These frequencies, frequency ratios, and covariance matrices
can be used to obtain tight constraint on the fundamental parameters of
these planet-hosting stars.},

	abstract = {Context. The measurement of obliquities - the angle between the orbital 
and stellar rotation - in star-planet systems is of great importance for
understanding planet system formation and evolution. The bright and
well-studied HAT-P-7 (Kepler-2) system is intriguing because several
Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) measurements found a high projected obliquity
in this system, but it was not possible so far to determine whether the
orbit is polar and/or retrograde. Aims: The goal of this study is
to measure the stellar inclination and hereby the full 3D obliquity of
the HAT-P-7 system instead of only the 2D projection as measured by the
RM effect. In addition, we provide an updated set of stellar parameters
for the star. Methods: We used the full set of available
observations from Kepler spanning Q0-Q17 to produce the power spectrum
of HAT-P-7. We extracted oscillation-mode frequencies via an Markov
chain Monte Carlo peak-bagging routine and used the results from this to
estimate the stellar inclination angle. Combining this with the
projected obliquity from RM and the inclination of the orbital plane
allowed us to determine the stellar obliquity. Furthermore, we used
asteroseismology to model the star from the extracted frequencies using
two different approaches to the modelling, for which either the stellar
evolution codes MESA or GARSTEC were adopted. Results: Our
updated asteroseismic modelling shows, i.a., the following stellar
parameters for HAT-P-7: M⋆ = 1.51+
0.04-0.05 M⊙, R⋆ =
2.00+ 0.01-0.02 R⊙, and age =
2.07+ 0.28-0.23 Gyr. The modelling offers a high
precision on the stellar parameters, the uncertainty on age, for
instance, is of the order ˜ 11\%. For the stellar inclination we
estimate i⋆{\textless} 36.5°, which translates
into an obliquity of 83°{\textless}ψ{\textless}
111°. The planet HAT-P-7b is likely retrograde in its
orbit, and the orbit is close to being polar. The new parameters for the
star give an updated planetary density of ρp = 0.65
± 0.03 g cm-3, which is lower than previous estimates.

	abstract = {This article presents and discusses a critical compilation of accurate, fundamental determinations of stellar masses and radii. We have
identified 95 detached binary systems containing 190 stars (94 eclipsing systems, and α Centauri) that satisfy our criterion that the mass and radius of both stars be known within errors of ±3\% accuracy
or better. All of them are non-interacting systems, and so the stars should have evolved as if they were single. This sample more than doubles that of the earlier similar review by Andersen (Astron Astrophys Rev 3:91-126, 1991), extends the mass range at both ends and, for the first time, includes an extragalactic binary. In every case, we have examined the original data and recomputed the stellar parameters with a consistent set of assumptions and physical constants. To these we add interstellar reddening, effective temperature, metal abundance,
rotational velocity and apsidal motion determinations when available, and we compute a number of other physical parameters, notably luminosity and distance. These accurate physical parameters reveal the effects of stellar evolution with unprecedented clarity, and we discuss the use of the data in observational tests of stellar evolution models in some detail. Earlier findings of significant structural differences between moderately fast-rotating, mildly active stars and single stars, ascribed to the presence of strong magnetic and spot activity, are confirmed beyond doubt. We also show how the best data can be used to test prescriptions for the subtle interplay between convection, diffusion, and other non-classical effects in stellar models. The amount and quality of the data also allow us to analyse the tidal evolution of the systems in considerable depth, testing prescriptions of rotational synchronisation and orbital circularisation in greater detail than possible before. We show that the formulae for pseudo-synchronisation of stars in eccentric orbits predict the observed rotations quite well, except for very young and/or widely separated stars. Deviations do occur, however, especially for stars with convective envelopes. The superior data set finally demonstrates that apsidal motion rates as predicted from General Relativity plus tidal theory are in good
agreement with the best observational data. No reliable binary data exist, which challenge General Relativity to any significant extent. The new data also enable us to derive empirical calibrations of M and R for single (post-) main-sequence stars above \{0.6 M\_\{odot\}\}. Simple, polynomial functions of T eff, log g and [Fe/H] yield M and R within errors of 6 and 3\%, respectively. Excellent agreement is found with independent determinations for host stars of transiting extrasolar planets, and good agreement with determinations of M and R from stellar models as constrained by trigonometric parallaxes and spectroscopic values of T eff and [Fe/H]. Finally, we list a set of 23 interferometric binaries with masses known to be better than 3\%, but without fundamental radius determinations (except α Aur). We
discuss the prospects for improving these and other stellar parameters in the near future.},

determinations have been hampered by these stars’ complex spectra
and dissimilarity to the Sun. We exploit an empirically calibrated
method to estimate spectroscopic effective temperature (Teff)
and the Stefan-Boltzmann law to determine radii of 183 nearby
K7-M7 single stars with a precision of 2\%-5\%. Our improved
stellar parameters enable us to develop model-independent relations
between Teff or absolute magnitude and radius, as well as
between color and Teff. The derived
Teff-radius relation depends strongly on [Fe/H], as
predicted by theory. The relation between absolute KS
magnitude and radius can predict radii accurate to ≃ 3\%. We derive
bolometric corrections to the
V\{\{R\}C\}\{\{I\}C\}grizJH\{\{K\}S\} and Gaia
passbands as a function of color, accurate to 1\%-3\%. We confront
the reliability of predictions from Dartmouth stellar evolution models
using a Markov chain Monte Carlo to find the values of unobservable
model parameters (mass, age) that best reproduce the observed effective
temperature and bolometric flux while satisfying constraints on distance
and metallicity as Bayesian priors. With the inferred masses we derive a
semi-empirical mass-absolute magnitude relation with a scatter of
2\% in mass. The best-agreement models overpredict stellar
Teff values by an average of 2.2\% and underpredict stellar
radii by 4.6\%, similar to differences with values from low-mass
eclipsing binaries. These differences are not correlated with
metallicity, mass, or indicators of activity, suggesting issues with the
underlying model assumptions, e.g., opacities or convective mixing

SDSS-III is a program of four spectroscopic surveys on three scientific
themes: dark energy and cosmological parameters, the history and
structure of the Milky Way, and the population of giant planets around
other stars. In keeping with SDSS tradition, SDSS-III will provide
regular public releases of all its data, beginning with SDSS Data
Release 8 (DR8), which was made public in 2011 January and includes
SDSS-I and SDSS-II images and spectra reprocessed with the latest
pipelines and calibrations produced for the SDSS-III investigations.
This paper presents an overview of the four surveys that comprise
SDSS-III. The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey will measure
redshifts of 1.5 million massive galaxies and Lyα forest spectra
of 150,000 quasars, using the baryon acoustic oscillation feature of
large-scale structure to obtain percent-level determinations of the
distance scale and Hubble expansion rate at z {\textless} 0.7 and at z ≈
2.5. SEGUE-2, an already completed SDSS-III survey that is the
continuation of the SDSS-II Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding
and Exploration (SEGUE), measured medium-resolution (R =
λ/Δλ ≈ 1800) optical spectra of 118,000 stars in
a variety of target categories, probing chemical evolution, stellar
kinematics and substructure, and the mass profile of the dark matter
halo from the solar neighborhood to distances of 100 kpc. APOGEE, the
Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment, will obtain
high-resolution (R ≈ 30,000), high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N {\textgreater}=
100 per resolution element), H-band (1.51 μm {\textless} λ {\textless} 1.70
μm) spectra of 105 evolved, late-type stars, measuring
separate abundances for {\textasciitilde}15 elements per star and creating the first
high-precision spectroscopic survey of all Galactic stellar populations
(bulge, bar, disks, halo) with a uniform set of stellar tracers and
spectral diagnostics. The Multi-object APO Radial Velocity Exoplanet
Large-area Survey (MARVELS) will monitor radial velocities of more than
8000 FGK stars with the sensitivity and cadence (10-40 m s-1,
{\textasciitilde}24 visits per star) needed to detect giant planets with periods up to
two years, providing an unprecedented data set for understanding the
formation and dynamical evolution of giant planet systems. As of 2011
January, SDSS-III has obtained spectra of more than 240,000 galaxies,
29,000 z {\textgreater}= 2.2 quasars, and 140,000 stars, including 74,000 velocity
measurements of 2580 stars for MARVELS.},

The relationships between these asteroseismic observables, such as the separations between mode frequencies, are able to significantly
constrain estimates of the ages and masses of these stars. We
investigate the scaling relation between the large frequency separation, Δν, and mean stellar density. Furthermore we present model
evolutionary tracks for several asteroseismic diagrams. We have extended the so-called C-D diagram beyond the main sequence to the subgiants and the red giant branch. We also consider another asteroseismic diagram, the epsilon diagram, which is more sensitive to variations in stellar properties at the subgiant stages and can aid in determining the correct mode identification. The recent discovery of gravity-mode period spacings in red giants forms the basis for a third asteroseismic diagram. We compare the evolutionary model tracks in these asteroseismic diagrams with results from pre-Kepler studies of solar-like oscillations and early results from Kepler.},

	abstract = {The advent of space-based missions like Kepler has revolutionized the 
study of solar-type stars, particularly through the measurement and
modeling of their resonant modes of oscillation. Here we analyze a
sample of 66 Kepler main-sequence stars showing solar-like oscillations
as part of the Kepler seismic LEGACY project. We use Kepler
short-cadence data, of which each star has at least 12 months, to create
frequency-power spectra optimized for asteroseismology. For each star,
we identify its modes of oscillation and extract parameters such as
frequency, amplitude, and line width using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte
Carlo “peak-bagging” approach. We report the extracted mode
parameters for all 66 stars, as well as derived quantities such as
frequency difference ratios, the large and small separations \{\vphantom{\}}\{\vphantom{\}}Δ
\vphantom{\{}\}\vphantom{\{}\}ν and δ \{ν \}02; the behavior of line widths
with frequency and line widths at \{ν \}{\textbackslash}max with
\{T\}\{eff\}, for which we derive parametrizations; and behavior
of mode visibilities. These average properties can be applied in future
peak-bagging exercises to better constrain the parameters of the stellar
oscillation spectra. The frequencies and frequency ratios can tightly
constrain the fundamental parameters of these solar-type stars, and mode
line widths and amplitudes can test models of mode damping and
excitation.},

It uses adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls, and supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP.

activity cycle. The variations in other activity proxies are found to be
well correlated with the variations in the acoustic frequencies.
However, each proxy has a slightly different time behaviour. Our goal is
to characterize the differences between the time behaviour of the
frequency shifts and of two other activity proxies, namely the area
covered by sunspots and the 10.7-cm flux. We define a new observable
that is particularly sensitive to the short-term frequency variations.
We then compare the observable when computed from model frequency shifts
and from observed frequency shifts obtained with the Global Oscillation
Network Group (GONG) for cycle 23. Our analysis shows that on the
shortest time-scales, the variations in the frequency shifts seen in the
GONG observations are strongly correlated with the variations in the
area covered by sunspots. However, a significant loss of correlation is
still found. We verify that the times when the frequency shifts and the
sunspot area do not vary in a similar way tend to coincide with the
times of the maxima of the quasi-biennial variations seen in the solar
seismic data. A similar analysis of the relation between the 10.7-cm
flux and the frequency shifts reveals that the short-time variations in
the frequency shifts follow even more closely those of the 10.7-cm flux
than those of the sunspot area. However, a loss of correlation between
frequency shifts and 10.7-cm flux variations is still found around the
same times.},

been known for 30 years. However, the relative importance of the
different contributions to the observed variations is not yet fully
understood. Our goal is to estimate the relative contribution from
sunspots to the observed activity-related variations in the frequencies
of the acoustic modes. We use a variational principle to relate the
phase differences induced by sunspots on the acoustic waves to the
corresponding changes in the frequencies of the global acoustic
oscillations. From the sunspot properties (area and latitude as a
function of time), we are able to estimate the spot-induced frequency
shifts. These are then combined with a smooth frequency shift component,
associated with long-term solar-cycle variations, and the results
compared with the frequency shifts derived from the Global Oscillation
Network Group data. The result of this comparison is consistent with a
sunspot contribution to the observed frequency shifts of roughly 30 per
cent, with the remaining 70 per cent resulting mostly from a global,
non-stochastic variation, possibly related to the changes in the overall
magnetic field. Moreover, analysis of the residuals obtained after the
subtraction of the model frequency shifts from the observations
indicates the presence of a 1.5-yr periodicity in the data in phase with
the quasi-biennial variations reported in the literature.},

of detection with the most commonly used technique, the periodogram, in
the case where the observation times are unevenly spaced. This choice
was made because, of the methods in current use, it appears to have the
simplest statistical behavior. A modification of the classical
definition of the periodogram is necessary in order to retain the simple
statistical behavior of the evenly spaced case. With this modification,
periodogram analysis and least-squares fitting of sine waves to the data
are exactly equivalent. Certain difficulties with the use of the
periodogram are less important than commonly believed in the case of
detection of strictly periodic signals. In addition, the standard method
for mitigating these difficulties (tapering) can be used just as well if
the sampling is uneven. An analysis of the statistical significance of
signal detections is presented, with examples},

photometric variations associated with these two effects produce very
similar phase curves. If observed through only a single bandpass, this
leads to a degeneracy between certain planetary parameters that hinder
the precise characterization of such planets. However, observing the
same planet through two different bandpasses gives much more information
about the planet. Here we develop a Bayesian methodology for combining
photometry from both Kepler and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey
Satellite. In addition, we demonstrate via simulations that one can
disentangle the reflected and thermally emitted light from the
atmosphere of a hot-Jupiter as well as more precisely constrain both the
geometric albedo and day-side temperature of the planet. This
methodology can further be employed using various combinations of

Modelling of the extracted parameters is performed by using grid-based methods using average parameters and individual frequencies together with spectroscopic parameters.

For C3 we still detected oscillations in 73\% of the observed stars that we proposed.

We distributed tens of individual oscillation frequencies extracted from the time series of each star among seven modelling teams who applied different methods to determine radii, masses, and ages for all stars in the sample. Comparisons among the different results reveal a good level of agreement in all stellar properties, which is remarkable considering the variety of codes, input physics and analysis methods employed by the different teams. Average uncertainties are of the order of \${\textbackslash}sim\$2{\textbackslash}\% in radius, \${\textbackslash}sim\$4{\textbackslash}\% in mass, and \${\textbackslash}sim\$10{\textbackslash}\% in age, making this the best-characterised sample of main-sequence stars available to date. Our predicted initial abundances and mixing-length parameters are checked against inferences from chemical enrichment laws \${\textbackslash}Delta Y / {\textbackslash}Delta Z\$ and predictions from 3D atmospheric simulations. We test the accuracy of the determined stellar properties by comparing them to the Sun, angular diameter measurements, Gaia parallaxes, and binary evolution, finding excellent agreement in all cases and further confirming the robustness of asteroseismically-determined physical parameters of stars when individual frequencies of oscillation are available. Baptised as the Kepler dwarfs LEGACY sample, these stars are the solar-like oscillators with the best asteroseismic properties available for at least another decade.

and Gaia DR1 (TGAS) for 2200 Kepler stars spanning from the main
sequence to the red-giant branch. We show that previously identified
offsets between TGAS parallaxes and distances derived from
asteroseismology and eclipsing binaries have likely been overestimated
for parallaxes ≲ 5\{--\}10 mas (≈90\%-98\% of the TGAS
sample). The observed differences in our sample can furthermore be
partially compensated by adopting a hotter \{T\}\{eff\} scale
(such as the infrared flux method) instead of spectroscopic temperatures
for dwarfs and subgiants. Residual systematic differences are at the
≈2\% level in parallax across three orders of magnitude. We use TGAS
parallaxes to empirically demonstrate that asteroseismic radii are
accurate to ≈5\% or better for stars between ≈ 0.8\{--\}8
\{R\}⊙ . We find no significant offset for main-sequence
(≲ 1.5 \{R\}⊙ ) and low-luminosity RGB stars
(≈3-8 \{R\}⊙ ), but seismic radii appear to be
systematically underestimated by ≈5\% for subgiants (≈1.5-3
\{R\}⊙ ). We find no systematic errors as a function of
metallicity between [\{Fe\}/\{\{H\}\}]≈ -0.8 to +0.4 dex, and show
tentative evidence that corrections to the scaling relation for the
large frequency separation (\{\{Δ \}\}ν ) improve the agreement
with TGAS for RGB stars. Finally, we demonstrate that beyond ≈ 3
\{kpc\} asteroseismology will provide more precise distances than
end-of-mission Gaia data, highlighting the synergy and complementary

	abstract = {During the past 10 years, a considerable amount of effort has been made to develop algorithms for automatic classification of variable stars. That has been primarily achieved by applying machine learning methods to photometric data sets where objects are represented as light curves. Classifiers require training sets to learn the underlying patterns that allow the separation among classes. Unfortunately, building training sets is an expensive process that demands a lot of human efforts. Every time data come from new surveys; the only available training instances are the ones that have a cross-match with previously labelled objects, consequently generating insufficient training sets compared with the large amounts of unlabelled sources. In this work, we present an algorithm that performs unsupervised classification of variable stars, relying only on the similarity among light curves. We tackle the unsupervised classification problem by proposing an untraditional approach. Instead of trying to match classes of stars with clusters found by a clustering algorithm, we propose a query-based method where astronomers can find groups of variable stars ranked by similarity. We also develop a fast similarity function specific for light curves, based on a novel data structure that allows scaling the search over the entire data set of unlabelled objects. Experiments show that our unsupervised model achieves high accuracy in the classification of different types of variable stars and that the proposed algorithm scales up to massive amounts of light curves.},

Asteroseismic Data Analysis gives a comprehensive technical introduction to this discipline. This book not only helps students and researchers learn about asteroseismology; it also serves as an essential instruction manual for those entering the field.The book presents readers with the foundational techniques used in the analysis and interpretation of asteroseismic data on cool stars that show solar-like oscillations.

	abstract = {The development of synoptic sky surveys has led to a massive amount of data for which resources needed for analysis are beyond human
capabilities. In order to process this information and to extract all possible knowledge, machine learning techniques become necessary. Here we present a new methodology to automatically discover unknown variable objects in large astronomical catalogs. With the aim of taking full advantage of all information we have about known objects, our method is based on a supervised algorithm. In particular, we train a random forest classifier using known variability classes of objects and obtain votes for each of the objects in the training set. We then model this voting distribution with a Bayesian network and obtain the joint voting distribution among the training objects. Consequently, an unknown object is considered as an outlier insofar it has a low joint probability. By leaving out one of the classes on the training set, we perform a validity test and show that when the random forest classifier attempts to classify unknown light curves (the class left out), it votes with an unusual distribution among the classes. This rare voting is detected by the Bayesian network and expressed as a low joint probability. Our method is suitable for exploring massive data sets given that the training process is performed offline. We tested our algorithm on 20 million light curves from the MACHO catalog and generated a list of anomalous candidates. After analysis, we divided the candidates into two main classes of outliers: artifacts and intrinsic outliers. Artifacts were principally due to air mass variation, seasonal variation, bad calibration, or instrumental errors and were consequently removed from our outlier list and added to the training set. After retraining, we selected about 4000 objects, which we passed to a post-analysis stage by performing a cross-match with all publicly available catalogs. Within these candidates we identified certain known but rare objects such as eclipsing Cepheids, blue variables, cataclysmic variables, and X-ray sources. For some outliers there was no additional information. Among them we identified three unknown variability types and a few individual outliers that will be followed up in order to perform a deeper analysis.},

One of the main aims of the Vista Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) near-infrared survey is to use them to map the structure of the Galactic Bulge. Owing to the large number of expected sources, this requires an automated mechanism for selecting RR Lyrae, and particularly those of the more easily recognized type ab (I.e., fundamental-mode pulsators), from the
106-107 variables expected in the VVV survey area. In this work we describe a supervised machine-learned classifier constructed for assigning a score to a Ks-band VVV light curve that indicates its likelihood of being ab-type RR Lyrae. We describe the key steps in the construction of the classifier, which were the choice of features, training set, selection of aperture, and family of classifiers. We find that the AdaBoost family of classifiers give consistently the best performance for our problem, and obtain a
classifier based on the AdaBoost algorithm that achieves a harmonic mean between false positives and false negatives of ≈7\% for typical VVV light-curve sets. This performance is estimated using cross-validation and through the comparison to two independent datasets that were classified by human experts.},

	abstract = {Obtaining accurate and precise masses and ages for large numbers of giant stars is of great importance for unraveling the assemblage history of the Galaxy. In this paper, we estimate masses and ages of 6940 red giant branch (RGB) stars with asteroseismic parameters deduced from {\textbackslash}emph\{Kepler\} photometry and stellar atmospheric parameters derived from LAMOST spectra. The typical uncertainties of mass is a few per cent, and that of age is \${\textbackslash}sim\${\textbackslash},20 per cent. The sample stars reveal two separate sequences in the age -- [\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/Fe] relation -- a high--\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ sequence with stars older than \${\textbackslash}sim\${\textbackslash},8{\textbackslash},Gyr and a low--\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ sequence composed of stars with ages ranging from younger than 1{\textbackslash},Gyr to older than 11{\textbackslash},Gyr. We further investigate the feasibility of deducing ages and masses directly from LAMOST spectra with a machine learning method based on kernel based principal component analysis, taking a sub-sample of these RGB stars as a training data set. We demonstrate that ages thus derived achieve an accuracy of \${\textbackslash}sim\${\textbackslash},24 per cent. We also explored the feasibility of estimating ages and masses based on the spectroscopically measured carbon and nitrogen abundances. The results are quite satisfactory and significantly improved compared to the previous studies.},

	abstract = {New spectroscopic surveys offer the promise of stellar parameters and abundances (“stellar labels”) for hundreds of thousands of
stars; this poses a formidable spectral modeling challenge. In many cases, there is a subset of reference objects for which the stellar labels are known with high(er) fidelity. We take advantage of this with The Cannon, a new data-driven approach for determining stellar labels from spectroscopic data. The Cannon learns from the “known”
labels of reference stars how the continuum-normalized spectra depend on these labels by fitting a flexible model at each wavelength; then, The Cannon uses this model to derive labels for the remaining survey stars. We illustrate The Cannon by training the model on only 542 stars in 19 clusters as reference objects, with \{T\}\{eff\}, \{log\} g, and [\{Fe\}/\{\{H\}\}] as the labels, and then applying it to the spectra of 55,000 stars from APOGEE DR10. The Cannon is very accurate. Its stellar labels compare well to the stars for which APOGEE pipeline (ASPCAP) labels are provided in DR10, with rms differences that are basically identical to the stated ASPCAP uncertainties. Beyond the reference labels, The Cannon makes no use of stellar models nor any line-list, but needs a set of reference objects that span label-space. The Cannon performs well at lower signal-to-noise, as it delivers comparably good labels even at one-ninth the APOGEE observing time. We discuss the limitations of The Cannon and its future potential, particularly, to bring different spectroscopic surveys onto a consistent scale of stellar labels.},

	abstract = {We combine results from interferometry, asteroseismology and spectroscopy to determine accurate fundamental parameters of 23 bright solar-type stars, from spectral type F5 to K2 and luminosity classes III-V. For some stars we can use direct techniques to determine the mass, radius, luminosity and effective temperature, and we compare with indirect methods that rely on photometric calibrations or spectroscopic analyses. We use the asteroseismic information available in the
literature to infer an indirect mass with an accuracy of 4-15 per cent. From indirect methods we determine luminosity and radius to 3 per cent. We find evidence that the luminosity from the indirect method is slightly overestimated (≈ 5 per cent) for the coolest stars,
indicating that their bolometric corrections (BCs) are too negative. For Teff we find a slight offset of -40 ± 20 K between the spectroscopic method and the direct method, meaning the spectroscopic temperatures are too high. From the spectroscopic analysis we determine the detailed chemical composition for 13 elements, including Li, C and O. The metallicity ranges from [Fe/H]=-1.7 to +0.4, and there is clear evidence for α-element enhancement in the metal-poor stars. We
find no significant offset between the spectroscopic surface gravity and the value from combining asteroseismology with radius estimates. From the spectroscopy we also determine v sin i and we present a new
calibration of macroturbulence and microturbulence. From the comparison between the results from the direct and spectroscopic methods we claim that we can determine Teff, log g and [Fe/H] with absolute accuracies of 80 K, 0.08 and 0.07 dex. Photometric calibrations of Strömgren indices provide accurate results for Teff and [Fe/H] but will be more uncertain for distant stars when interstellar reddening becomes important. The indirect methods are important to obtain reliable estimates of the fundamental parameters of relatively faint stars when interferometry cannot be used. This paper is the first to compare direct and indirect methods for a large sample of stars, and we conclude that indirect methods are valid, although slight corrections may be needed.},

	abstract = {We study the construction of coresets for kernel density estimates. That is we show how to approximate the kernel density estimate described by a large point set with another kernel density estimate with a much smaller point set. For characteristic kernels (including Gaussian and Laplace kernels), our approximation preserves the \$L\_{\textbackslash}infty\$ error between kernel density estimates within error \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$, with coreset size \$2/{\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}2\$, but no other aspects of the data, including the
dimension, the diameter of the point set, or the bandwidth of the kernel common to other approximations. When the dimension is unrestricted, we show this bound is tight for these kernels as well as a much broader set. This work provides a careful analysis of the iterative Frank-Wolfe algorithm adapted to this context, an algorithm called {\textbackslash}emph\{kernel herding\}. This analysis unites a broad line of work that spans
statistics, machine learning, and geometry. When the dimension \$d\$ is constant, we demonstrate much tighter bounds on the size of the coreset specifically for Gaussian kernels, showing that it is bounded by the size of the coreset for axis-aligned rectangles. Currently the best known constructive bound is \$O({\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{{\textbackslash}epsilon\} {\textbackslash}log{\textasciicircum}d
{\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{{\textbackslash}epsilon\})\$, and non-constructively, this can be improved by \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbackslash}log {\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{{\textbackslash}epsilon\}\}\$.

calibrations are valid for an effective temperature range 3100-10 000 K
for dwarfs of spectral types M5 to A0 and 3100-5700 K for giants of

(RCIC), the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (gr) and the
Two Micron All Sky Survey (JHKs), have been calibrated.
Restricted by the metallicity range of the current sample, the
calibrations are mainly applicable for disc stars ([Fe/H] ≳ - 1.0).
The normalized percentage residuals of the calibrations are typically
2.0 and 1.5 per cent for dwarfs and giants, respectively. Some
systematic discrepancies at various levels are found between the current
scales and those available in the literature (e.g. those based on the
infrared flux method or spectroscopy). Based on the current
calibrations, we have re-determined the colours of the Sun. We have also
investigated the systematic errors in effective temperatures yielded by
the current on-going large-scale low- to intermediate-resolution stellar

the estimation of stellar effective temperature for those on-going or

	abstract = {We present interferometric angular diameter measurements of 21 low-mass, K- and M-dwarfs made with the CHARA Array. This sample is enhanced by adding a collection of radius measurements published in the literature to form a total data set of 33 K-M-dwarfs with diameters measured to better than 5\%. We use these data in combination with the Hipparcos parallax and new measurements of the star's bolometric flux to compute absolute luminosities, linear radii, and effective temperatures for the stars. We develop empirical relations for {\textasciitilde}K0 to M4 main-sequence stars that link the stellar temperature, radius, and luminosity to the observed (B - V), (V - R), (V - I), (V - J), (V
- H), and (V - K) broadband color index and stellar
metallicity [Fe/H]. These relations are valid for metallicities ranging from [Fe/H] = -0.5 to +0.1 dex and are accurate to {\textasciitilde}2\%, {\textasciitilde}5\%, and {\textasciitilde}4\% for temperature, radius, and luminosity, respectively. Our results show that it is necessary to use metallicity-dependent transformations in order to properly convert colors into stellar temperatures, radii, and luminosities. Alternatively, we find no sensitivity to metallicity on relations we construct to the global properties of a star omitting color information, e.g., temperature-radius and temperature-luminosity. Thus, we are able to empirically quantify to what order the star's observed color index is impacted by the stellar iron abundance. In addition to the empirical relations, we also provide a representative look-up table via stellar spectral classifications using this collection of data. Robust examinations of single star temperatures and radii compared to evolutionary model predictions on the luminosity-temperature and luminosity-radius planes reveal that models overestimate the temperatures of stars with surface temperatures {\textless}5000 K by {\textasciitilde}3\%, and underestimate the radii of stars with radii {\textless}0.7 R ⊙
by {\textasciitilde}5\%. These conclusions additionally suggest that the models over account for the effects that the stellar metallicity may have on the astrophysical properties of an object. By comparing the
interferometrically measured radii for the single star population to those of eclipsing binaries, we find that for a given mass, single and binary star radii are indistinguishable. However, we also find that for a given radius, the literature temperatures for binary stars are systematically lower compared to our interferometrically derived temperatures of single stars by {\textasciitilde}200 to 300 K. The nature of this offset is dependent on the validation of binary star temperatures, where bringing all measurements to a uniform and correctly calibrated
temperature scale is needed to identify any influence stellar activity may have on the physical properties of a star. Lastly, we present an empirically determined H-R diagram using fundamental properties
presented here in combination with those in Boyajian et al. for a total of 74 nearby, main-sequence, A- to M-type stars, and define regions of habitability for the potential existence of sub-stellar mass companions in each system.},

In addition, these CHARA-determined temperatures, radii, and luminosities are fit to Yonsei-Yale model isochrones to constrain the masses and ages of the stars. These results are compared to indirect estimates of these quantities obtained by collecting photometry of the stars and applying them to model atmospheres and evolutionary isochrones. We find that for most cases, the models overestimate the effective temperature by {\textasciitilde}1.5\%-4\% when compared to our directly measured values. The
overestimated temperatures and underestimated radii in these works appear to cause an additional offset in the star's surface gravity measurements, which consequently yield higher masses and younger ages, in particular for stars with masses greater than {\textasciitilde}1.3 M

We assess both random and systematic sources of error and include a

uncertainties in the main catalog properties are of the order of 80 K in
T eff, 0.06 dex in [M/H], 0.014 dex in log g, and 12\% and 5\%
in mass and radius, respectively; these reflect a combination of
systematic and random errors. Asteroseismic surface gravities are
substantially more precise and accurate than spectroscopic ones, and we
find good agreement between their mean values and the calibrated
spectroscopic surface gravities. There are, however, systematic
underlying trends with T eff and log g. Our effective
temperature scale is between 0 and 200 K cooler than that expected from
the infrared flux method, depending on the adopted extinction map, which
provides evidence for a lower value on average than that inferred for
the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). We find a reasonable correspondence

scales, with increased dispersion in KIC metallicities as the absolute
metal abundance decreases, and offsets in T eff and log g

parameters are required and independent verification of the results is
mandatory. With this purpose, we present a new technique to obtain
stellar properties by coupling asteroseismic analysis with the InfraRed
Flux Method. By using two global seismic observables and multi-band
photometry, the technique allows us to obtain masses, radii, effective
temperatures, bolometric fluxes, and hence distances for field stars in
a self-consistent manner. We apply our method to 22 solar-like
oscillators in the Kepler short-cadence sample, that have accurate
Hipparcos parallaxes. Our distance determinations agree to better than
5\%, while measurements of spectroscopic effective temperatures and
interferometric radii also validate our results. We briefly discuss the

series of nine months of data for each star. The 61 stars observed were
categorised in three groups: simple, F-like, and mixed-mode. The simple
group includes stars for which the identification of the mode degree is
obvious. The F-like group includes stars for which the identification of
the degree is ambiguous. The mixed-mode group includes evolved stars for
which the modes do not follow the asymptotic relation of low-degree
frequencies. Following this categorisation, the power spectra of the 61
main-sequence and subgiant stars were analysed using both maximum
likelihood estimators and Bayesian estimators, providing individual mode
characteristics such as frequencies, linewidths, and mode heights. We
developed and describe a methodology for extracting a single set of mode
frequencies from multiple sets derived by different methods and
individual scientists. We report on how one can assess the quality of
the fitted parameters using the likelihood ratio test and the posterior
probabilities. Results: We provide the mode frequencies of 61

spacing (Δν), for a large number of time series. We present an
effective method based on the autocorrelation function to find excess
power and use a scaling relation to estimate granulation timescales as
initial conditions for background modelling. We derive reliable
uncertainties for νmax and Δν through extensive simulations.
We have tested the pipeline on about 2000 simulated Kepler stars with

νmax and Δν for about half of the sample. For about 20\%, the

	abstract = {Context: We conducted a 5-night observing run with the spectrometer harps at the ESO 3.6-m telescope in August 2006, to continue exploring the asteroseismic properties of F-type stars. In fact, Doppler
observations of F-type on the main sequence are demanding and remain currently limited to a single case (HD 49933). Comparison with
photometric results obtained with the CoRoT space mission (Convection, Rotation and planetary Transits) on similar stars will be possible with an enhanced set of observations. Aims: We selected the 4th magnitude F8V star HD 203608 to investigate the oscillating properties of a low-metallicity star of the old galactic disk. Methods: We reduced the spectra with the on-line data reduction software provided by the instrument. We developed a new statistical approach for extracting the significant peaks in the Fourier domain. Results: The oscillation spectrum shows a significant excess power in the frequency range [1.5, 3.0 mHz]. It exhibits a large spacing of about 120.4 μHz at 2.5 mHz. Variations of the large spacing with frequency are clearly identified, which require an adapted asymptotic development. The modes identification is based on the unambiguous signature of 15 modes with ℓ = 0 and 1. Conclusions: These observations show the
potential diagnostic of asteroseismic constraints. Including them in the stellar modeling significantly enhances the precision on the physical parameters of HD 203608, resulting in a much more precise position in the HR diagram. The age of the star is now determined in the range 7.25±0.07 Gyr.

Because the RC is easily recognizable within the data of large
spectroscopic and asteroseismic surveys, it is a useful probe of stellar densities, kinematics, and chemical abundances across the Milky Way disk; it can be applied up to larger distances than that allowed by dwarfs; and it has better accuracy than is possible with other kinds of giants. Here, we discuss the reasons for the RC narrowness in several sets of observational data, its fine structure, and the presence of systematic changes in the RC properties as regards age, metallicity, and the observed passband.

individual candidates by the likelihood that they are indeed planets:
98.8\% of the time it ranks plausible planet signals higher than
false-positive signals in our test set. We apply our model to a new set
of candidate signals that we identified in a search of known Kepler
multi-planet systems. We statistically validate two new planets that are
identified with high confidence by our model. One of these planets is
part of a five-planet resonant chain around Kepler-80, with an orbital
period closely matching the prediction by three-body Laplace relations.

One of the difficulties in this determination is to know the evolutionary state of the individual stars – i.e. have they started to burn Helium in their cores? That is the topic of this paper. Asteroseismic data provide a route to achieving this information. What we present here is a highly autonomous way of determining the evolutionary state from an analysis of the power spectrum of the light curve. The method is fast and efficient and can provide results for a large number of stars. It uses the structure of the dipole-mode oscillations, which have a mixed character in red-giant stars, to determine some measures that are used in the categorization. It does not require that all the individual components of any given mode be separately characterized. Some 6604 red-giant stars have been classified. Of these, 3566 are determined to be on the red-giant branch, 2077 are red-clump and 439 are secondary-clump stars. We do not specifically identify the low-metallicity, horizontal-branch stars. The difference between red-clump and secondary-clump stars is dependent on the manner in which Helium burning is first initiated. We discuss that the way the boundary between these classifications is set may lead to mis-categorization in a small number of stars. The remaining 522 stars were not classified either because they lacked sufficient power in the dipole modes (so-called depressed dipole modes) or because of conflicting values in the parameters.},

in their cores and instead burn hydrogen in a surrounding shell. Once a
red giant is sufficiently evolved, the helium in the core also undergoes
fusion. Outstanding issues in our understanding of red giants include
uncertainties in the amount of mass lost at the surface before helium
ignition and the amount of internal mixing from rotation and other
processes. Progress is hampered by our inability to distinguish between
red giants burning helium in the core and those still only burning
hydrogen in a shell. Asteroseismology offers a way forward, being a
powerful tool for probing the internal structures of stars using their
natural oscillation frequencies. Here we report observations of
gravity-mode period spacings in red giants that permit a distinction
between evolutionary stages to be made. We use high-precision photometry
obtained by the Kepler spacecraft over more than a year to measure
oscillations in several hundred red giants. We find many stars whose
dipole modes show sequences with approximately regular period spacings.
These stars fall into two clear groups, allowing us to distinguish
unambiguously between hydrogen-shell-burning stars (period spacing
mostly {\textasciitilde}50seconds) and those that are also burning helium (period
spacing {\textasciitilde}100 to 300 seconds).},

The period spacings of these mixed modes are directly dependent on the density gradient between the core region and the convective envelope.},

	abstract = {There are no good predictions for the amplitudes expected from solar-like oscillations in other stars. In the absence of a definitive model for convection, which is thought to be the mechanism that excites these oscillations, the amplitudes for both velocity and luminosity measurements must be estimated by scaling from the Sun. In the case of luminosity measurements, even this is difficult because of disagreement over the solar amplitude. This last point has lead us to investigate whether the luminosity amplitude of oscillations δL/L can be
derived from the velocity amplitude (v\_osc\_). Using linear theory and observational data, we show that p-mode oscillations in a large sample of pulsating stars satisfy (δL/L)\_bol\_\{prop.to\} v\_osc\_/T\_eff\_.
Using this relationship, together with the best estimate of
v\_osc\_,sun\_=(23.4+/-1.4)cm/s, we estimate the luminosity amplitude of solar oscillations at 550nm to be
δL/L=(4.7+/-0.3)ppm. Next we discuss how to scale the amplitude of solar-like (i.e., convectively-powered) oscillations from the Sun to other stars. The only predictions come from model calculations by Christensen-Dalsgaard \& Frandsen (1983, Sol. Phys. 82, 469).
However, their grid of stellar models is not dense enough to allow amplitude predictions for an arbitrary star. Nevertheless, although convective theory is complicated, we might expect that the general properties of convection - including oscillation amplitudes - should change smoothly through the colour-magnitude diagram. Indeed, we find that the velocity amplitudes predicted by the model calculations are well fitted by the relation v\_osc\_\{prop.to\}L/M. These two relations allow us to predict both the velocity and luminosity amplitudes of solar-like oscillations in any given star. We compare these predictions with published observations and evaluate claims for detections that have appeared in the literature. We argue that there is not yet good evidence for solar-like oscillations in any star except the Sun. For solar-type stars (e.g., α Cen A and β Hyi), observations have not yet
reached sufficient sensitivity to detect the amplitudes we predict. For some F-type stars, namely Procyon and several members of M67, detection sensitivities 30-40\% below the predicted amplitudes have been achieved. We conclude that these stars must oscillate with amplitudes less than has generally been assumed.},

Aims: We give a simple bolometric correction for the amplitudes of

of non-radial modes. Methods: We numerically compute the
bolometric correction cK-bol and mode visibilities for
different effective temperatures Teff within the range

a2(Teff - To)2, with
To = 5934 K, a1 = 1.349 × 10-4

We give tabulated values for the mode visibilities based on

Teff ∈ [4000,7500] K, log g ∈ [2.5,4.5] , and [M/H]

for visibilities. We point out the limits of these classical visibility

to hot plasma rising to the photosphere where it cools down and descends
back into the interior at the edges of granules. This is the visible
manifestation of convection taking place in the outer part of the solar
convection zone. Because red giants have deeper convection zones than
the Sun, we cannot a priori assume that their granulation is a scaled
version of solar granulation. Until now, neither observations nor
one-dimensional analytical convection models could put constraints on
granulation in red giants. With asteroseismology, this study can now be
performed. We analyze {\textasciitilde}1000 red giants that have been observed by Kepler
during 13 months. We fit the power spectra with Harvey-like profiles to
retrieve the characteristics of the granulation (timescale
τgran and power P gran). We search for a
correlation between these parameters and the global acoustic-mode
parameter (the position of maximum power, νmax) as well as
with stellar parameters (mass, radius, surface gravity (log g), and
effective temperature (T eff)). We show that
τeffvpropν-0.89 max and P
granvpropν-1.90 max, which is
consistent with the theoretical predictions. We find that the
granulation timescales of stars that belong to the red clump have
similar values while the timescales of stars in the red giant branch are
spread in a wider range. Finally, we show that realistic
three-dimensional simulations of the surface convection in stars,
spanning the (T eff, log g) range of our sample of red
giants, match the Kepler observations well in terms of trends.},

The CoRoT 5-month long observation runs provide us with the opportunity to analyze a large variety of red-giant stars and derive their fundamental parameters from their asteroseismic properties. Aims: We perform an analysis of more than 4600 CoRoT light curves to extract as much information as possible. We take into account the characteristics of both the star sample and the method to ensure that our asteroseismic results are as unbiased as possible. We also study and compare the properties of red giants in two opposite regions of the Galaxy. Methods: We analyze the time series using the envelope autocorrelation function to extract precise asteroseismic parameters with reliable error bars. We examine first the mean wide frequency separation of solar-like oscillations and the frequency of the maximum seismic amplitude, then the parameters of the excess power envelope. With the additional information of the effective temperature, we derive the stellar mass and radius. Results: We identify more than 1800 red giants among the 4600 light curves and obtain accurate distributions of the stellar parameters for about 930 targets. We are able to reliably measure the mass and radius of several hundred red giants. We derive precise information about the stellar population distribution and the red clump. By comparing the stars observed in two different fields, we find that the stellar asteroseismic properties are globally similar, but that the characteristics are different for red-clump stars. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the efficiency of statistical asteroseismology: validating scaling relations allows us to infer fundamental stellar parameters, derive precise information about red-giant evolution and interior structure, analyze and compare stellar populations from different fields.

age-[α/Fe] distribution of stars in the solar neighbourhood.
However, robust constraints on stellar ages are currently available for
only a limited number of stars. The all-sky survey TESS (Transiting
Exoplanet Survey Satellite) will observe the brightest stars in the sky
and thus can be used to investigate the age distributions of stars in
these components of the Galaxy via asteroseismology, where previously
this has been diffcult using other techniques. The aim of this
preliminary study was to determine whether TESS will be able to provide
evidence for quenching periods during the star formation history of the
Milky Way. Using a population synthesis code, we produced populations
based on various stellar formation history models and limited the
analysis to red-giant-branch stars. We investigated the
mass-Galactic-disk-height distributions, where stellar mass was used as
an age proxy, to test for whether periods of quenching can be observed
by TESS. We found that even with the addition of 15\% noise to the
inferred masses, it will be possible for TESS to find evidence
for/against quenching periods suggested in the literature (e.g. between
7 and 9 Gyr ago), therefore providing stringent constraints on the
formation and evolution of the Milky Way.},

be fully optimized if these archives contain, besides the actual
observations, annotations about the variability class of the objects
they contain. Supervised classification of observations produces these
tags, and makes it possible to generate refined candidate lists and
catalogues suitable for further investigation. Aims: We aim to
extend and test the classifiers presented in a previous work against an
independent dataset. We complement the assessment of the validity of the
classifiers by applying them to the set of OGLE light curves treated as
variable objects of unknown class. The results are compared to published
classification results based on the so-called extractor methods. Methods: Two complementary analyses are carried out in parallel. In
both cases, the original time series of OGLE observations of the
Galactic bulge and Magellanic Clouds are processed in order to identify
and characterize the frequency components. In the first approach, the
classifiers are applied to the data and the results analyzed in terms of
systematic errors and differences between the definition samples in the
training set and in the extractor rules. In the second approach, the
original classifiers are extended with colour information and, again,
applied to OGLE light curves. Results: We have constructed a
classification system that can process huge amounts of time series in
negligible time and provide reliable samples of the main variability
classes. We have evaluated its strengths and weaknesses and provide
potential users of the classifier with a detailed description of its
characteristics to aid in the interpretation of classification results.
Finally, we apply the classifiers to obtain object samples of classes
not previously studied in the OGLE database and analyse the results. We
pay specific attention to the B-stars in the samples, as their
pulsations are strongly dependent on metallicity.

	abstract = {Context: The fast classification of new variable stars is an important step in making them available for further research. Selection of science targets from large databases is much more efficient if they have been classified first. Defining the classes in terms of physical parameters is also important to get an unbiased statistical view on the variability mechanisms and the borders of instability strips. Aims: Our goal is twofold: provide an overview of the stellar variability classes that are presently known, in terms of some relevant stellar parameters; use the class descriptions obtained as the basis for an automated
“supervised classification” of large databases. Such
automated classification will compare and assign new objects to a set of pre-defined variability training classes. Methods: For every variability class, a literature search was performed to find as many well-known member stars as possible, or a considerable subset if too many were present. Next, we searched on-line and private databases for their light curves in the visible band and performed period analysis and harmonic fitting. The derived light curve parameters are used to describe the classes and define the training classifiers. Results: We compared the performance of different classifiers in terms of percentage of correct identification, of confusion among classes and of computation time. We describe how well the classes can be separated using the proposed set of parameters and how future improvements can be made, based on new large databases such as the light curves to be assembled by the CoRoT and Kepler space missions. Conclusions: The derived classifiers' performances are so good in terms of success rate and computational speed that we will evaluate them in practice from the application of our methodology to a large subset of variable stars in the OGLE database and from comparison of the results with published OGLE variable star classifications based on human intervention. These results will be published in a subsequent paper.

The data from this redesigned mission present a specific challenge; the targets systematically drift in position on an ∼6 hr timescale, inducing a significant instrumental signal in the photometric time series—this greatly impacts the ability to detect planetary signals and perform asteroseismic analysis. Here we detail our version of a reduction pipeline for K2 target pixel data, which automatically defines masks for all targets in a given frame; extracts the
target’s flux and position time series; corrects the time series based on the apparent movement on the CCD (either in 1D or 2D), combined with the correction of instrumental and/or planetary signals via the Kepler Asteroseismic Science Operations Center (KASOC) filter, thus rendering the time series ready for asteroseismic analysis; computes power spectra for all targets and identifies potential contaminations between targets. From a test of our pipeline on a sample of targets from the K2 campaign 0, the recovery of data for multiple targets increases the amount of potential light curves by a factor of ≥slant 10.

characterized en masse for the first time. These characterizations are
pivotal for endeavors such as searching for Earth-like planets and solar
twins, understanding the mechanisms that govern stellar evolution, and
tracing the dynamics of our Galaxy. The volume of data that is becoming
available, however, brings with it the need to process this information
accurately and rapidly. While existing methods can constrain fundamental
stellar parameters such as ages, masses, and radii from these
observations, they require substantial computational effort to do so. We
develop a method based on machine learning for rapidly estimating
fundamental parameters of main-sequence solar-like stars from classical
and asteroseismic observations. We first demonstrate this method on a
hare-and-hound exercise and then apply it to the Sun, 16 Cyg A and B,
and 34 planet-hosting candidates that have been observed by the Kepler
spacecraft. We find that our estimates and their associated
uncertainties are comparable to the results of other methods, but with
the additional benefit of being able to explore many more stellar
parameters while using much less computation time. We furthermore use
this method to present evidence for an empirical diffusion-mass
relation. Our method is open source and freely available for the
community to use.6},

It will obtain 30-minute cadence observations of all objects in the TESS fields of view, along with 2-minute cadence observations of 200,000 to 400,000 selected stars. The choice of which stars to observe at the 2-min cadence is driven by the need to detect small transiting planets, which leads to the selection of primarily bright, cool dwarfs. We describe the catalogs assembled and the algorithms used to populate the TESS Input Catalog (TIC). We also describe a ranking system for all stars in the sky according to the smallest transiting planet detectable, and assemble a Candidate Target List (CTL) using that ranking. We discuss additional factors that affect the ability to photometrically detect and dynamically confirm small planets, and we note additional stellar populations of special interest that may be added to the final target list. The TIC is available on the STScI MAST server, and an enhanced CTL is available through the Filtergraph data visualization portal system at http://filtergraph.vanderbilt.edu/tess\_ctl .},

	abstract = {For the vast majority of stars in the second Gaia data release, reliable 
distances cannot be obtained by inverting the parallax. A correct
inference procedure must instead be used to account for the nonlinearity
of the transformation and the asymmetry of the resulting probability
distribution. Here we infer distances to essentially all 1.33 billion
stars with parallaxes published in the second Gaia data release. This is
done using a weak distance prior that varies smoothly as a function of
Galactic longitude and latitude according to a Galaxy model. The
irreducible uncertainty in the distance estimate is characterized by the
lower and upper bounds of an asymmetric confidence interval. Although
more precise distances can be estimated for a subset of the stars using
additional data (such as photometry), our goal is to provide purely
geometric distance estimates, independent of assumptions about the
physical properties of, or interstellar extinction towards, individual
stars. We analyse the characteristics of the catalogue and validate it
using clusters. The catalogue can be queried using ADQL at
http://gaia.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/tap.html (which also hosts the Gaia
catalogue) as the table geometric\_distance in the schema

	abstract = {A critical bottleneck for stellar astrophysics and exoplanet science using data from the \$Kepler\$ mission has been the lack of precise radii and evolutionary states of the observed target stars. Here we present revised radii of 186,813 \$Kepler\$ stars derived by combining parallaxes from \$Gaia\$ Data Release 2 with the DR25 \$Kepler\$ Stellar Properties Catalog. The median radius precision is \${\textbackslash}approx\$8\%, a factor 4-5 improvement over previous estimates for typical \$Kepler\$ stars. We find that \${\textbackslash}approx\$65\% (\${\textbackslash}approx\$ 128,000) of all \$Kepler\$ targets are main-sequence stars, \${\textbackslash}approx\$23\% (\${\textbackslash}approx\$ 40,600) are subgiants, and \${\textbackslash}approx\$12\% (\${\textbackslash}approx\$ 23,000) are red giants, demonstrating that subgiant contamination is less severe than previously thought and that the \$Kepler\$ parent population mostly consists of unevolved
main-sequence stars. Using the revised stellar radii, we recalculate the radii for 2218 confirmed and 1958 candidate exoplanets. Our results confirm the presence of a gap in the radius distribution of small, close-in planets, but yield evidence that the gap is mostly limited to incident fluxes \${\textgreater}\$200\$F\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ and may be located closer to
2\$R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$. We furthermore find several confirmed exoplanets which occupy the "hot super-Earth desert", detect direct evidence for a correlation of gas-giant planet inflation with increasing incident flux, and establish a bona-fide sample of 8 confirmed planets and 34 planet candidates with \${\textless} 2 R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ in the habitable zone. The results presented here demonstrate the enormous potential for the precise characterization of stellar and exoplanet populations using the
transformational dataset provided by \$Gaia\$.},

	abstract = {Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia DR2) contains results for 1693 million sources in the magnitude range 3 to 21 based on observations collected by the European Space Agency Gaia satellite during the first 22 months of its operational phase. We describe the input data, models, and processing used for the astrometric content of Gaia DR2, and the validation of these results performed within the astrometry task. Some 320 billion centroid positions from the pre-processed astrometric CCD observations were used to estimate the five astrometric parameters (positions, parallaxes, and proper motions) for 1332 million sources, and
approximate positions at the reference epoch J2015.5 for an additional 361 million mostly faint sources. Special validation solutions were used to characterise the random and systematic errors in parallax and proper motion. For the sources with five-parameter astrometric solutions, the median uncertainty in parallax and position at the reference epoch J2015.5 is about 0.04 mas for bright (G{\textless}14 mag) sources, 0.1 mas at G=17 mag, and 0.7 mas at G=20 mag. In the proper motion components the corresponding uncertainties are 0.05, 0.2, and 1.2 mas/yr, respectively. The optical reference frame defined by Gaia DR2 is aligned with ICRS and is non-rotating with respect to the quasars to within 0.15 mas/yr. From the quasars and validation solutions we estimate that systematics in the parallaxes depending on position, magnitude, and colour are generally below 0.1 mas, but the parallaxes are on the whole too small by about 0.03 mas. Significant spatial correlations of up to 0.04 mas in parallax and 0.07 mas/yr in proper motion are seen on small ({\textless}1 deg) and
intermediate (20 deg) angular scales. Important statistics and
information for the users of the Gaia DR2 astrometry are given in the appendices.},

	abstract = {The Gaia spacecraft of the European Space Agency (ESA) has been securing observations of solar system objects (SSOs) since the beginning of its operations. Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) contains the observations of a selected sample of 14,099 SSOs. These asteroids have been already identified and have been numbered by the Minor Planet Center. Positions are provided for each Gaia observation at CCD level. As additional information, the apparent brightness of SSOs in the unfiltered G band is also provided for selected observations. We explain the processing of SSO data, and describe the criteria we used to select the sample published in Gaia DR2. We then explore the data set to assess its quality. To exploit the epoch astrometry of asteroids in Gaia DR2 it is necessary to take into account the unusual properties of the
uncertainty, as the position information is nearly one-dimensional. When this aspect is handled appropriately, an orbit fit can be obtained with post-fit residuals that are overall consistent with the a-priori error model that was used to define individual values of the astrometric uncertainty. The distribution of residuals allowed us to identify possible contaminants in the data set. Photometry in the G band was compared to computed values from reference asteroid shapes and to the flux registered at the corresponding epochs by the red and blue
photometers (RP and BP). The overall astrometric performance is close to the expectations, with an optimal range of brightness G{\textasciitilde}12-17. In this range, the typical transit-level accuracy is well below 1 mas. For fainter asteroids, the growing photon noise deteriorates the
performance. Asteroids brighter than G{\textasciitilde}12 are affected by a lower performance of the processing of their signals. The dramatic improvement brought by Gaia DR2 astrometry of SSOs is demonstrated by preliminary tests on the detection of subtle non-gravitational effects.},

We discuss the characteristics of SC data obtained in the 33.5 day long Quarter 1 observations with Kepler which completed on 2009 June 15. The truly excellent time series precisions are nearly Poisson limited at 11th magnitude providing per-point measurement errors of 200 parts-per-million per minute. For extremely saturated stars near seventh magnitude precisions of 40 ppm are reached, while for background limited measurements at 17th magnitude precisions of 7 mmag are maintained. We note the presence of two additive
artifacts, one that generates regularly spaced peaks in frequency, and one that involves additive offsets in the time domain inversely
proportional to stellar brightness. The difference between LC and SC sampling is illustrated for transit observations of TrES-2.},

The KIC is a catalog containing photometric and physical data for sources in the Kepler mission field of view; it is used by the mission to select optimal targets. Four of the visible-light (g, r, i, z) magnitudes used in the KIC are tied to Sloan Digital Sky Survey magnitudes; the fifth (D51) is an AB magnitude calibrated to be consistent with Castelli \& Kurucz (CK) model atmosphere fluxes. We derived atmospheric extinction corrections from hourly observations of secondary standard fields within the Kepler field of view. For these filters and extinction estimates, repeatability of absolute photometry for stars brighter than magnitude 15 is typically 2\%. We estimated stellar parameters \{T eff, log (g), log (Z), E B - V \} using Bayesian posterior probability maximization to match observed colors to CK stellar atmosphere models. We applied Bayesian priors describing the distribution of solar-neighborhood stars in the color-magnitude diagram, in log (Z), and in height above the galactic plane. Several comparisons with samples of stars classified by other means indicate that for 4500 K {\textless}=T eff {\textless}= 6500 K, our classifications are reliable within about ±200 K and 0.4 dex in
log (g) for dwarfs, with somewhat larger log (g) uncertainties for giants. It is difficult to assess the reliability of our log (Z) estimates, but there is reason to suspect that it is poor, particularly at extreme T eff. Comparisons between the CK models and observed colors are generally satisfactory with some exceptions, notably for stars cooler than 4500 K. Of great importance for the Kepler mission, for T eff {\textless}= 5400 K, comparison with
asteroseismic results shows that the distinction between main-sequence stars and giants is reliable with about 98\% confidence. Larger errors in log (g) occur for warmer stars, for which our filter set provides inadequate gravity diagnostics. The KIC is available through the MAST data archive.},

It is designed to decode the history of the Milky Way, trace the emergence of the chemical elements, reveal the inner workings of stars, and investigate the origin of planets. It will also create an integral-field spectroscopic map of the gas in the Galaxy and the Local Group that is 1,000x larger than the current state of the art and at high enough spatial resolution to reveal the self-regulation mechanisms of galactic ecosystems. SDSS-V will pioneer systematic, spectroscopic monitoring across the whole sky, revealing changes on timescales from 20 minutes to 20 years. The survey will thus track the flickers, flares, and radical transformations of the most luminous persistent objects in the universe: massive black holes growing at the centers of galaxies. The scope and flexibility of SDSS-V will be unique among extant and future spectroscopic surveys: it is all-sky, with matched survey infrastructures in both hemispheres; it provides near-IR and optical multi-object fiber spectroscopy that is rapidly reconfigurable to serve high target densities, targets of opportunity, and time-domain
monitoring; and it provides optical, ultra-wide-field integral field spectroscopy. SDSS-V, with its programs anticipated to start in 2020, will be well-timed to multiply the scientific output from major space missions (e.g., TESS, Gaia, eROSITA) and ground-based projects. SDSS-V builds on the 25-year heritage of SDSS's advances in data analysis, collaboration infrastructure, and product deliverables. The project is now refining its science scope, optimizing the survey strategies, and developing new hardware that builds on the SDSS-IV infrastructure. We present here an overview of the current state of these developments as we seek to build our worldwide consortium of institutional and
